enlargement of time in which to file an application for leave to appeal from Wilcox Js orders of 22 March 2005 see Sharman License Holdings Ltd v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd 2005 FCA 802 per Lindgren J delivered on 17 June 200524 All that was referrable of course to the implications of the payment of 111640563 by Ms Hemming to TIL following the sale of her Sydney residence on 4 February 2005 that payment appears to have been made out of the proceeds of a sale of that residence which was effected for the gross price of 2100000 to a person identified by the evidence as an accountant of certain of the Sharman companies There was no sufficiently detailed or otherwise cogent evidence as to who exercised the substantial or underlying control of decision making of TIL or as to the basis of or reasons for such alleged indebtedness having crystallised in the first place The state of the evidence as to the control of TIL was itself the subject of disputation before Moore J and senior counsel for the Sharman applicants sought to attribute error to his Honours judgment for the further reason that he had failed to make a finding as to Ms Hemmings control or otherwise of that entity The Sharman applicants postulated that the remark made by Lindgren J at 13 of his Honours reasons for judgment in Sharman License Holdings Ltd v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd 2005 FCA 802 that Wilcox J accepted in the course of granting the Mareva relief on 22 March 2005 that the Sharman Companies were controlled by Ms Hemming by reason of a client services agreement between her and TIL dated 8 April 2002 was an unsure foundation for any finding of control of the Sharman trust or the Sharman companies by Ms Hemming and was thus inappropriately or impermissibly relied upon by Moore J in formulating his reasons for judgment That submission lacked merit particularly in the light of 31 of Lindgren Js reasons for judgment in which his Honour paraphrased the twofold acceptance given in crossexamination by the solicitor acting for Sharman License and Sharman Networks in their application before Lindgren J that TIL as trustee of the Sharman trust was the ultimate beneficial owner of all the shares issued in Sharman License and Sharman Networks and moreover that Wilcox J had himself appeared to accept that in consequence of the client services agreement Ms Hemming controlled the Sharman trust25 The Music companies had submitted to Moore J that given the evidentiary shortcomings on a subject readily susceptible to documentary demonstration inclusive of banking records I might add there was in truth and reality no antecedent loan that the transfer of those funds by Ms Hemming to TIL in Vanuatu constituted a sham transaction and consequently that those monies remained her own property beneficially and should have been identified and disclosed as such in her affidavit provided in the Mareva context Once more so it was asserted by the Sharman applicants his Honour declined to make any concluded finding on the subject The point is however that his Honour had been able to infer from the surrounding circumstances I have already outlined that there was some force in the Music companies submission But in any event his Honour was of the view that he could permit crossexamination of Ms Hemming on and in relation to those matters because at least doubt existed in relation to that area of enquiry32 It is readily apparent that the primary judge placed significant weight and I think rightly so upon the following findings made by Lindgren J in the context of the preceding interlocutory proceedings of Sharman License Holdings Ltd v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd 2005 FCA 802  being proceedings which I have referred to earlier At 15 of his reasons for judgment Lindgren J observed as follows  As noted earlier the Sharman Companies were ultimately beneficially owned by TIL as trustee of the Sharman Trust and notwithstanding the reference to discretion and the right of termination the client services agreement provided evidence before his Honour that TIL including TIL as trustee of the Sharman Trust was likely to act at the direction of Ms Hemming Since TIL as trustee of the Sharman Trust was the ultimate beneficial owner of all the issued shares in the Sharman Companies there was evidence before his Honour to show that they were also likely to act at her direction  Earlier at 4 his Honour had observed   On 4 February 2005 Ms Hemming and Richard KilmerBarber settled a sale of their home at Castle Cove in Sydney to John Simon Myers for 2100000 Title was transferred on 16 February 2005 Ms Hemming and Dr KilmerBarber continued to occupy the property Ms Hemmings interest in the home was apparently her only substantial asset within the jurisdiction There was evidence before his Honour that Mr Myers occupied some role such as accountant or bookkeeper of the Sharman Companies Ms Hemming was the Chief Executive Officer of the Sharman Companies Out of the proceeds of sale 111640563 was transferred to a bank account in Vanuatu which is where the Sharman Companies are incorporated33 After reviewing in some detail the Australian authorities relating to misuse or abuse of process and of Mareva orders and also the evidence placed before him in the present segment of the proceedings in particular that concerned with Ms Hemmings apparent control of Sharman Networks and Wilcox Js conclusions thereon Moore J expressed his satisfaction that Ms Hemming should be required to swear a disclosure affidavit in relation to Sharman Networks assets largely for the reasons I have already canvassed and which I will reproduce below the same having been the focus of much of the respective parties submissions made in the present interlocutory proceedings at 36 and 37  This leads to a consideration of whether Ms Hemming should be cross examined on her affidavits concerning disclosure of her assets In my opinion such an order should be made The evidence points clearly to the structure reflected in the Sharman trust and the arrangements in Vanuatu more generally having been established by Ms Hemming Counsel for the applicants described that structure as opaque This is in an apt description However it is in my opinion unnecessary for me to resolve some specific issues concerning that structure which were the subject of argument One was whether the fourth respondent has a beneficial interest in the Sharman trust or at least has an interest which should have been identified in her disclosure affidavit Not only is the evidence on this issue likely to be incomplete Ms Hemming has proffered no evidence and almost certainly the applicants do not have all relevant records  they do not even have the trust deed but it is also by no means clear to me how the law of Vanuatu would operate on the arrangements revealed to this point by the evidence It would be unsatisfactory dealing with the type of issues presently under consideration to proceed on the basis that the law in that country can be presumed to be the same as the law of Australia see The Parchim 1918 AC 157 at 161 The findings of Wilcox J point towards a conclusion that she does have such an interest If this issue is explored in cross examination then the Court will be left with a greater measure of certainty about whether she does   The transfer of the property by Ms Hemming to another has several unusual features It occurred at a time when final submissions were being made in the primary proceedings Registration of the transfer occurred five days after the applicants final submissions were served on the respondents One can infer that the strengths and weaknesses of the respective cases would have been apparent to the parties and those advising them The transferee was to a person associated with Ms Hemming He was an accountant who had work sic for the Sharman companies A significant part of the proceeds of the sale were paid to TIL This was in settlement of what was said to be a loan While some of the documents in evidence can be viewed as supporting the existence of a loan they nonetheless suggest a loan was made after the property was purchased That itself is unusual though one must accept there may be an explanation for this including as counsel for Ms Hemming pointed out that the funds lent replaced bridging finance But the evidence suggests that a loan was not secured by a mortgage In all real doubts arise about and uncertainty surrounds the reason why this transaction took place when it did and whether the moneys transferred to TIL were in truth in satisfaction of a loan or continues to constitute an asset of and requires disclosure by Ms Hemming Greater clarity about this matter may arise from the cross examination of Ms Hemming

06_1.xml,c8,discussed,Brilliant Digital Entertainment Pty Ltd v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd (2004) 63 IPR 373,8 It was the Music companies contention that the orders of Moore J from which leave to appeal is now sought determined matters of practice and procedure within the foregoing statements of principle involving as they did the obligation of Ms Hemming to submit to crossexamination on affidavits made by her in early April of this year and to file a separate affidavit disclosing the assets of Sharman Networks Those obligations were said to be no different in principle to any other interlocutory procedural order of the court whether made pretrial or during a trial requiring parties to swear affidavits to answer questions in crossexamination and to provide documentation On the question of what constitutes substantial injustice for the purposes of determining an application for leave to appeal counsel for the Music companies placed particular reliance upon the decision of the Full Federal Court delivered earlier in the primary proceedings which denied leave to appeal from a decision by Wilcox J refusing to set aside Anton Piller orders that his Honour had earlier made Brilliant Digital Entertainment Pty Ltd v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd 2004 63 IPR 373 I will refer further to that authority shortly13 The Music companies for their part placed particular reliance upon the joint reasons for judgment of Black CJ and Stone J in Brilliant Digital for the approach that they contended ought to be adopted in my consideration of the present application for leave to appeal In refusing leave to appeal from Wilcox Js decision to decline to set aside earlier Anton Piller orders that had been made in the course of the subject litigation their Honours were said not to have considered at all the merits of the contemplated appeal there in issue The following passages appearing at 78 and 1314 of their Honours reasons for judgment in Brilliant Digital were asserted by the Music companies to be apposite to the present application   7 In our view these matters the matters contended by the applicants to amount to substantial injustice would not either individually or cumulatively occasion injustice to the applicants of such a character and to such a degree as to justify the grant of leave While it is neither necessary nor appropriate to attempt to define the concept of substantial injustice some observations may be ventured The flexibility of the principles governing the grant of leave to appeal indicates that the concept of substantial injustice must also be flexible The requirement of leave to appeal indicates however that substantial injustice requires something more than that the subject decision is incorrect otherwise the criterion would be superfluous The qualification of injustice by substantial points to a detriment that while not necessarily irreparable is more than mere inconvenience or delay in the exercise of a right    8 The distinction between interlocutory decisions concerning matters of practice and procedure and those that concern the substantive interests of the parties recognises both the greater likelihood of an incorrect decision as to a substantive right causing substantial injustice and the importance of preserving a judges power to supervise the orderly preparation of a matter for trial In determining whether there has been substantial injustice it is appropriate for the court to take these factors into account The need to keep a tight rein upon interference with orders at first instance that do not determine substantive rights has even more force today in the context of procedural reforms and active case management undertaken with a view to the early identification of the real issues between the parties and the expeditious and efficient resolution of them   13 The challenged orders were plainly directed to matters of practice and procedure and did not determine any substantive rights They were directed to the capture and preservation of certain data and information and this purpose has now been effected Importantly the applicants for leave do not seek to reverse this by destruction of the material seized pursuant to the challenged orders The primary judge has now made orders relating to the use of the material seized including its safekeeping by an independent party and subject to appropriate confidentiality undertakings the making of a safety or backup copy of the material Orders have also been made granting preliminary access to the material for the purpose of any application that includes material not falling within the challenged orders The music companies are to have only such access to the seized material as would be normally available on discovery This shows that there is presently in train an orderly process for the management of the seized material in which the interests of both parties will receive due consideration   14 In these circumstances we are far from satisfied that substantial injustice would follow from refusing the application for leave to appeal and on that basis we would refuse leave to appeal That being so we do not propose to comment on the correctness or otherwise of the decision of the primary judge Nothing we have said should be taken as suggesting that the making of the challenged orders was not a serious matter requiring very careful consideration by the primary judge plainly whether or not the applicants are correct in their contention that his decision was erroneous the application for the challenged orders and the subsequent application to set them aside did receive consideration of that character   The emphasis appearing in 7 above in nonitalics is mine14 The Music companies contended that the orders made by Moore J were truly interlocutory in nature rather than substantial in effect being directed to the capture and preservation of assets of the Sharman applicants pursuant to the Mareva relief granted They pointed out that Moore J had reached his decision to impose those orders after careful application of the relevant legal principles with due consideration of the lengthy evidence put before him by both parties Moreover Moore J was said to have made it clear in 39 of his reasons for judgment that any crossexamination would be subject to the control of the Court thereby limiting any prejudice that may be suffered by Ms Hemming or the other applicants In those circumstances counsel for the Music companies further contended that the applicants had failed to show that the obligations imposed upon them by Moore J amounted to anything greater than mere inconvenience On that footing the Music companies concluded that the Sharman applicants had failed to overcome the threshold requirement of establishing substantial injustice and that leave to appeal should be refused on that basis alone Acceptance of that proposition was said to have the consequence realistically that consideration of the draft grounds of appeal from Moore Js judgment as formulated by the Sharman applicants would not be necessary There is considerable force in those submissions of the Music companies15 The Sharman applicants submitted that Brilliant Digital was distinguishable from the present circumstances because in the former instance the orders the subject of application for leave to appeal arose from an Anton Piller order that had already been executed but in the present case Ms Hemming was yet to be crossexamined and had not as at the date of hearing of the application sworn an affidavit for instance on behalf of Sharman Networks I should interpolate to record that subsequent to reserving judgment on the question of leave to appeal the Sharman applicants applied for a stay on Moore Js order requiring Ms Hemming to file that affidavit and that I refused to grant that stay but made orders requiring the affidavit to be left in a sealed envelope to be opened only upon further order of the Court Because a Full Court on appeal is in a position to intervene in relation to the subjection of Ms Hemming to Moore Js orders and because those orders were made on the Sharman applicants case erroneously by his Honour it was contended by the Sharman applicants to be unjust if leave to appeal was not to be granted in relation to his Honours orders16 The Sharman applicants further submitted that the Full Court regularly grants leave to appeal where it can be shown that the exercise of a discretion has miscarried and where that miscarriage in the exercise of a discretion involves an important question of principle citing as authority Wong at 22 In Wong  the Full Federal Court held that the primary judge had failed to correctly apply the relevant legal test grounding the order made below No mention was made by the Full Court of the need to establish substantial injustice before a grant of leave to appeal is to be made Counsel for the Music companies submitted in response that Wong was of no assistance since it was a decision made as a result of the primary judge having ordered the filing of interrogatories in the absence of evidence from the party sought to be interrogated going beyond a mere allegation So much was said to stand in contrast with the considerable array of evidence provided respectively to Wilcox Lindgren and Moore JJ at various interlocutory stages concerning Ms Hemmings control of the Sharman companies and a related and involved trust estate In any event the Music companies submitted that the Courts decision in Wong must be read subject to the later reasons of the Full Court in Brilliant Digital  which required inter alia that substantial injustice be shown There is in my opinion clear force in those submissions of the Music companies34 With respect to the carefully as well as forcefully presented submissions made to the Court by senior counsel for the Sharman applicants I am unable to distil material or significant error in the approach of the primary judge It was readily to be inferred by the primary judge from the material placed before his Honour that Ms Hemming did exercise what his Honour described as a central role in relation to the business of Sharman Networks and moreover that Mr Gee who was put forward by the Sharman applicants as having performed that role was  only in form an appropriate person to have provided the principal affidavit evidence on behalf of the Sharman companies I have not found the observations appearing in the English authorities to which I have been referred by the Sharman applicants and which I have extracted to be of assistance at least in contextual circumstances such as here involved where the Sharman applicants have resorted to offshore transactions bearing no evident commercial significance at least of transparency and did so in part coincidentally upon the unsuccessful involvement of the Sharman parties and their entities in the very substantial Universal Music litigation which concluded on the question of liability on 5 September 2005 At least in circumstances such as those the description Star Chamber interrogatory procedures is inapposite Moreover in line with the observations made in Brilliant Digital  the orders here complained of are in substance at least presently concerned with matters of practice and procedure and not substantive interests of the parties35 Largely upon the footing of the foregoing findings and his Honours further findings as to the Sharman companies principal deponent of affidavit evidence being Mr Gee having been  only in form an appropriate person though not in substance and instead his having been essentially a cipher I am unable to accept otherwise than that the primary judge was correct in his view that it is not possible to be affirmatively satisfied that the disclosure is now complete and further in pointing out that Mr Myers testimony did  not provide sufficient assurance that Mr Gees affidavits can on their face be accepted as constituting a full disclosure36 In the light of my preceding discussion and analysis I also think that his Honour was right to have concluded in the following terms at 39 in the course of rejecting the Sharman applicants contention that the subjection of Ms Hemming to crossexamination amounted to an abuse of the Courts process  I accept that the Music companies would wish to ascertain who are the real and effective controllers of the Sharman companies I also accept that this may become a matter about which questions might be asked if the orders sought by the applicants are made However if that becomes a legitimate area of cross examination bearing in mind that any cross examination will be subject to the control of the Court it will be for a legitimate purpose and not an illegitimate and collateral one I do not accept the criticisms of the way the Music companies identified and characterised the breaches of the disclosure order In particular Sharman License and Sharman Networks elected to provide the disclosure affidavits required of them from a person appropriate in form but not in substance The Music companies who necessarily cannot be certain from their own knowledge of the matters to which the disclosure affidavits related were entitled to review critically the affidavits proffered by those Sharman companies All the more so given the opaque structure reflected in the Sharman trust and the arrangements in Vanuatu more generally and referred to above While some of the criticisms were not significant they included the failure to disclose significant sums held by lawyers on trust I am not satisfied that the application should be dismissed for the reasons advanced by the Sharman applicants37 In making order 3 on 17 November 2005 it was submitted that Moore J also fell into error The effect of order 3 was said to extend the freezing order to the assets of Sharman Licence which was erroneous because his Honour had overlooked the implications of the circumstance that Wilcox J had found in the main proceedings that such company had been completely successful and the claims made against it had been wholly dismissed Thus at 40 his Honour held as follows  In view of Wilcox Js conclusions concerning the liability of Sharman License no such order should be made concerning that company  It was apparently common ground moreover that Sharman Licence was a wholly owned subsidiary of Sharman Networks So much was said by the Sharman parties to have been entirely overlooked when his Honour concluded at 40 of his reasons as follows    the proposed order is intended to bind existing respondents and prohibiting them from causing or permitting any whollyowned subsidiary from dealing with its assets subject to the exceptions in the order as originally formulated This appears to me to be an appropriate extension of the original Mareva order and will ensure that assets of the respondents held indirectly through whollyowned subsidiaries will be controlled in the same way and for the same purpose as assets directly held to which the Mareva order presently applies  I am unable however to comprehend why Sharman Licenses subsidiary status in relation to Sharman Networks should exclude it from the operation of the order of the Court below which understandably was so framed as to extend to any wholly owned subsidiary As pointed out by the Music companies such an order does not have the effect of extending the Mareva order to Sharman Licenses assets per se  but rather the order prevents Sharman Networks from causing its subsidiaries to dispose of their assets38 In the result I am of the opinion that the application of the Sharman parties for leave to appeal

06_1.xml,c9,discussed,Minister for Immigration  Multicultural  Indigenous Affairs v Wong [2002] FCAFC 327,9 The Sharman applicants sought to emphasise the existence of practical burdens imposed by the orders made by Moore J on 17 November 2005 although in reality it was principally with respect to the order for crossexamination of Ms Hemming to which that assertion was directed They maintained that the requirement to appear for crossexamination was not analogous to the routine steps of swearing an affidavit during the normal course of a trial and entering the witness box to answer questions related to its contents Rather the requirement to be crossexamined on an asset disclosure affidavit was said to be at the extreme end of the Courts armoury by virtue of the fact that the making of an order for crossexamination on an affidavit of this kind is predicated upon the Court having implicitly found the deponent of that affidavit to be in contempt of court I was referred by the Sharman applicants to an earlier Full Federal Court decision in Minister for Immigration  Multicultural  Indigenous Affairs v Wong 2002 FCAFC 327 in support of their submission that since the present circumstances give rise to an important question of principle leave to appeal should be readily granted10 The affidavit filed in support of the application for leave to appeal by Mr Rohan Higgins the solicitor for the Sharman applicants contained the following broad submission under the heading injustice if leave is refused  If leave to appeal is not granted then the orders of Moore J will operate and will have to be complied with Any subsequent challenge to those orders would then be futile and academic The orders are interlocutory in form but final in the result in relation to the issues raised So much is correct as a general statement as to the consequences of his Honours orders However the nature and context of the application for leave here involved in practical terms an appeal or virtually so as will hereafter emerge11 The Music companies contended that the Sharman applicants submissions proceeded in reality on the erroneous basis that every interlocutory decision that requires a party to do an act will be automatically susceptible to leave to appeal and to being stayed The Music companies position was that the orders requiring Ms Hemming to file an affidavit disclosing the assets of Sharman Networks and to attend for crossexamination on the affidavit she had earlier sworn as to disclosure of her assets were merely procedural in nature and therefore incapable as such of determining any final rights of the parties So much accorded with Moore Js understanding of the nature of those orders as indicated in 30 of his Honours reasons for judgment16 The Sharman applicants further submitted that the Full Court regularly grants leave to appeal where it can be shown that the exercise of a discretion has miscarried and where that miscarriage in the exercise of a discretion involves an important question of principle citing as authority Wong at 22 In Wong  the Full Federal Court held that the primary judge had failed to correctly apply the relevant legal test grounding the order made below No mention was made by the Full Court of the need to establish substantial injustice before a grant of leave to appeal is to be made Counsel for the Music companies submitted in response that Wong was of no assistance since it was a decision made as a result of the primary judge having ordered the filing of interrogatories in the absence of evidence from the party sought to be interrogated going beyond a mere allegation So much was said to stand in contrast with the considerable array of evidence provided respectively to Wilcox Lindgren and Moore JJ at various interlocutory stages concerning Ms Hemmings control of the Sharman companies and a related and involved trust estate In any event the Music companies submitted that the Courts decision in Wong must be read subject to the later reasons of the Full Court in Brilliant Digital  which required inter alia that substantial injustice be shown There is in my opinion clear force in those submissions of the Music companies
06_1.xml,c10,cited,Gerlach v Clifton Bricks Pty Ltd [2002] HCA 22 ; (2002) 209 CLR 478,12 The primary submission made by the Music companies as to why leave to appeal ought not to be granted related to the failure of the Sharman applicants to adduce evidence demonstrative of the claim that they would suffer substantial injustice should leave be refused The Music companies rejected any notion to the effect that the mere fact of Ms Hemming being compelled to swear an affidavit as to disclosure of Sharman Networks assets and to attend for crossexamination upon her own disclosure affidavits without more amounted to substantial injustice in the sense that such expression has been used in numerous authorities concerned with the grant of leave to appeal Reference was made to Gerlach v Clifton Bricks Pty Ltd 2002 HCA 22  2002 209 CLR 478 in which Gaudron McHugh and Hayne JJ in a different context considered that the bare proposition that an order mandating trial by judge alone as opposed to trial by judge and jury can amount without more to a substantial wrong to a party or to a miscarriage of justice was a startling proposition The reality of the dilemma in which the Court is placed by the present application is the need for consideration in some depth of the matters to which attention has been drawn by the Sharman applicants before determining whether leave to appeal ought formally to be granted to appeal in the first place The Sharman applicants relied upon a further passage from the majoritys reasons for judgment in Gerlach at 13 as follows  The principles governing the grant of leave to appeal against interlocutory orders are well establishedIf it is plain that wrong principle was applied by the judge considering the application it may well be that leave should be granted

06_1.xml,c13,discussed,Bayer AG v Winter (No 2) [1986] 1 WLR 540,19 Thus in Den Norske Bank ASA v Antonatos 1999 QB 271 Waller LJ with whom Chadwick and Millett LJJ agreed said in a passage at 290 upon which the Sharman applicants placed reliance  It is finally important to recognise that it is only in exceptional circumstances that crossexamination will be ordered on an affidavit sworn pursuant to a Mareva order see House of Spring Gardens Ltd v Waite 1985 FSR 173 at 181 per Slade LJ The anxieties expressed by Scott J in Bayer AG v Winter No 2 1986 1 WLR 540 relating to the court wanting no part of a star chamber process must constantly be borne in mind  The passage from the reasons for judgment of Slade LJ in House of Spring Gardens referred to by Waller LJ above reads as follows   I can very well see that on the particular facts of many cases perhaps most cases the court might not consider it just and convenient to order the crossexamination of a defendant who has filed an affidavit in purported compliance with a Mareva order in a case where the plaintiff has not yet seen fit to issue a motion for contempt and is not seeking an order for the swearing of a second affidavit by the defendant concerned  Whether there has occurred purported compliance with a Mareva order must surely be viewed in terms of substance as well as mere form Lord Justice Slade made those remarks in the course of overruling the decision of Scott J at first instance which decision had been to the effect that a court did not have the power under s 37 of the Supreme Court Act 1981 UK to make an order requiring crossexamination ancillary to compliance with a Mareva order in the absence of circumstances whereby a justiciable issue is before the Court in respect of which the evidence of the deponent is relevant to the resolution thereof for instance where the deponent of the disclosure affidavit was the subject of a contempt motion The anxieties expressed by Scott J and also referred to by Waller LJ in Den Norske Bank  appear in Scott Js earlier reasons for judgment in Bayer AG v Winter No 2 1986 1 WLR 540 In that latter case Scott J was concerned with an application seeking orders that the defendant submit to crossexamination on a wide range of matters in aid of earlier Anton Piller and Mareva orders made by the Court Scott J referred to the scope of the crossexamination contemplated at 543 as follows   Mr Prescott for the plaintiff made clear that the purpose of his proposed crossexamination of the first defendant is a freeranging one He proposes to question him as to the whereabouts of his assets worldwide He proposes to question him as to his knowledge of and part played in transactions in counterfeit Baygon wherever they may have happened20 The primary proceedings in Bayer concerned allegations of an organised system for the sale of counterfeit Baygon insecticide products As at the time of the hearing before the presiding judge no statement of claim had been filed Moreover no evidence proving the allegations of sale of counterfeit Baygon was placed before the presiding judge for the purposes of the application and at no stage had the defendant had an opportunity to confront any such evidence Counsel for the plaintiff had indicated to the presiding judge that pending receipt of certain answers in crossexamination the plaintiffs were minded subsequently to pursue contempt proceedings against the defendant It was in those somewhat extreme circumstances well removed from the present context here presented that Scott J made the following emphatic statement at 544 in the course of refusing the order sought for the crossexamination of the defendant being dictum upon which the Sharman applicants placed reliance in the present context  Star Chamber interrogatory procedure has formed no part of the judicial process in this country for several centuries The proper function of a judge in civil litigation is to decide issues between parties It is not in my opinion to preside over an interrogation   The police charged with the upholding of the public law cannot subject a citizen to crossexamination before a judge in order to discover the truth about the citizens misdeeds How then as a matter of discretion can it be right in a civil case in aid of rights which however important are merely private rights to subject a citizen to such a crossexamination A fortiori it cannot be right to do so in a case where the plaintiff seeking the crossexamination of the defendant is holding itself free to use the defendants answers for the purpose of an application to commit him to prison for contempt  I would respectfully withhold from any such somewhat characterisation of the present conduct of the Music companies in their pursuit of what seems to me to be both reasonable and authentic means designed to ensure that Mareva relief is afforded adequate facilitation and implementation in the context of Music companies intellectual property protection and preservation upheld by the primary judge in the principal litigation21 Senior counsel for the Sharman applicants asserted that nowhere in the reasons for judgment of Moore J is there a finding that the disclosures made by Mr Gee of the assets of the relevant two Sharman companies were incomplete or that the disclosures by Ms Hemming in her affidavits as to her own assets were incomplete I would first observe that any finding of Moore J on the completeness or otherwise of Mr Gees disclosure affidavits could not possibly have any bearing upon the appropriateness of his Honours order requiring Ms Hemming to attend for crossexamination on her own affidavits and any suggestion to the contrary is in my opinion incorrect Moreover any such conclusion begs the question as to the operation of the notion of incomplete and the context in which it is used The theme of the primary judges concern was more in the nature of inadequacy and lack of clarity Senior counsel for the Sharman applicants asserted that the Music companies had not demonstrated that Ms Hemmings assets included what he termed the beneficial interest in the Sharman companies or that the loan transaction with TIL was a sham A present concern of the Music companies is indeed with the beneficial ownership of funds In the case of tangible and intangible assets subjected to the interposition of a complexity of offshore established companies and trust estates purportedly controlled by an offshore trustee corporation the task of gaining access to and control of those assets in order to enforce onshore court judgments and orders can be an expensive and formidable undertaking for a successful litigant It was in the light of the complexity and opacity concerning Ms Hemmings apparent employment of a Vanuatu trust instrument that the primary judge observed for the time being as follows at 36   it is in my opinion unnecessary for me to resolve some specific issues concerning that structure which were the subject of argument One was whether Ms Hemming has a beneficial interest in the Sharman trust or at least has an interest which should have been identified in her disclosure affidavit22 Senior counsel for the Sharman applicants submitted that having failed to make a finding on this point the primary judge appeared to have concluded that the power to order crossexamination should be exercised in order to allow the matter of any such beneficial ownership to be further explored his Honour observing in that context at 36  If this issue was explored in crossexamination then the Court will be left with a greater measure of certainty about whether she does have an interest in the Sharman companies per medium of the Sharman trust23 In further response to the primary judges endeavours to distil an expedient means for the ascertainment relevantly of beneficial ownership it was contended by the Sharman applicants that in circumstances such as the present an order for crossexamination of a deponent cannot be made unless the Court is affirmatively satisfied that there has been a nondisclosure all that being said to have involved a resolution of the arguments expressly eschewed by Moore J in 36 of his reasons I have difficulty with that contention In the context of his Honours review of some of the offshore as well as onshore transactions his Honour had made the significant finding along the way as it were that the evidence  suggests a loan was made after the property was purchased and also that a loan was not secured by a mortgage Consequently his Honour was able to observe at 37 that  real doubts arise about and uncertainty surrounds the reason why this transaction took place when it did and whether the moneys transferred to TIL were in truth in satisfaction of a loan or continues to constitute an asset of and requires disclosure by Ms Hemming In the circumstances I have thus far recorded that was an apposite observation

06_1.xml,c16,cited,Cardile v LED Builders Pty Ltd [1999] HCA 18 ; (1999) 198 CLR 380,27 My reading of his Honours reasons here was that he was far from satisfied with the nature or extent of the purported offshore structures and transactions to the extent apparent from the evidence involving as they did the creation of a trust estate somewhat cognate to what have often been described as blind trusts Concerns of that nature appear to have persuaded or assisted to persuade the primary judge of the need to order that Ms Hemming submit to crossexamination on her disclosure affidavits In determining to take that approach his Honour paid regard to the relevant authorities dealing with both the grant of Mareva relief and the making of orders ancillary to the same including orders requiring the swearing of disclosure affidavits and crossexamination on those affidavits After reviewing the relevant principles enunciated in those authorities his Honour concluded at 28   ultimately the cautionary words of the four members of the High Court in  Cardile v LED Builders Pty Ltd 1999 HCA 18  1999 198 CLR 380 at 403404 set out at 18 above must be heeded Orders made in the Courts ancillary jurisdiction must be founded on a doctrinal and principled basis A Mareva order is protective of the Courts processes including the efficacy of execution of those orders Orders concerning disclosure affidavits and cross examination can in turn be made to render the Mareva order more efficacious This is the touchstone for determining whether leave should be given to cross examine A relevant consideration in determining whether leave should be given might in an appropriate case be the failure of the deponent of a disclosure affidavit to disclose assets completely or promptly or both In such a case leave might be given because doubts might arise about whether the deponent had understood and accepted the obligations and burdens imposed by the Mareva order and the ancillary order requiring the disclosure affidavit Cross examination might be appropriate to test whether the disclosure affidavits fully revealed all assets on which the Mareva order operated and which might be available to satisfy any judgment However in other cases other more significant factors might support the granting of leave to cross examine  The cautionary words of the High Court in Cardile earlier extracted by his Honour at 18 of his reasons below referred to the need for courts to exercise caution in making Mareva orders and to only do so upon a principled basis having regard to the impact that those orders may have on respondents and third parties28 It was submitted nevertheless on behalf of the Sharman applicants that the premise upon which the application for an order for crossexamination order proceeded here was that Ms Hemming had breached the order requiring her to disclose her assets and that the basis upon which the Music companies litigated the proceedings below was to seek to convince the primary judge that there had occurred inadequate disclosure on the footing that Ms Hemming did have a substantial asset namely beneficial interests in the Sharman companies and further that the loan transaction with TIL was in truth a sham arrangement Those issues were to have been debated before his Honour at length below but were never resolved Certainly the premise upon which the order is sought as I have already sought to explain was an inadequacy of disclosure of such matters in circumstances that indicated the need for further exploration and inquiry29 It was next asserted by the Sharman applicants that the high point of his Honours conclusion below both as to the socalled putative ownership by Ms Hemming of the Sharman Trust and as to the existence or otherwise of the loan made by TIL to Ms Hemming repaid in February 2005 was that there was a lack of clarity about the matter My observation is however that any such lack of clarity about the alleged loan and its repayment or partial repayment derives from its inherently commercially inexplicable origins and purposes in the first place It was submitted therefore to be an unprincipled exercise of discretion for his Honour to have ordered crossexamination in circumstances where the Music companies had not convinced his Honour upon either of those conditions which they had raised In truth so the submissions continued his Honour fell into the error of making an order for crossexamination in circumstances where no basis had been demonstrated to the Court to make such an order For reasons I have already ventured the concerns relevantly expressed by his Honour were more than some mere lack of clarity30 In conclusion therefore it was the case of the Sharman applicants that Moore J failed correctly to apply the relevant legal principles in committing Ms Hemming to crossexamination on her disclosure affidavit and that it must follow that the Sharman applicants would inherently suffer substantial injustice if Ms Hemming be so required to submit to crossexamination in accordance with the relief granted by the primary judge In short the complaint was that Moore J gave leave for the crossexamination to take place because the Court might be left with a greater measure of certainty 36 and further because crossexamination may lead to greater clarity 37 and that so much exemplified errors in principle in the exercise of his discretion31 In my opinion and for the reasons I have largely foreshadowed in my observations upon the submissions already recorded the application for leave to appeal brought by the Sharman applicants has not sufficient cogency to justify the grant of any such leave The case of the Music companies presented to the primary judge Moore J for relief of the nature and to the extent granted was sufficiently in line with established principle as to be clear from sufficient doubt I do not think that the United Kingdom and Australian authorities establish inflexible requirements to the extent postulated by the Sharman applicants in particular concerning the Courts jurisdiction to grant leave to crossexamine the deponents of disclosure affidavits in Mareva contexts His Honours approach in particular to the issue of granting leave to the Music companies to crossexamine Ms Hemming was soundly justified in the light of the evidentiary circumstances concerning the Sharman applicants offshore trust structure and the circumstances of and context in which such a substantial sum of money was transferred to an offshore company in the amount and in the context that occurred

1990 92 ALR 490 at 494 This case also involved an application under s 52 Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth for misleading and deceptive conduct in relation to the sale of a business The majority of the Full Court said   We reiterate that where a purchase has been induced by misleading conduct it is not enough in order to recover losses subsequent to the purchase to prove that but for the misleading conduct or as a partial consequence of it the agreement to purchase would not have been made that is so in every successful application of that kind It is not the law that in every such case the party held to have been engaged in misleading conduct who may have acted quite innocently becomes the insurer of the others success and prima facie liable to indemnify him against the consequences of the purchase As the trial judge said in the present case   To recover a loss sustained in the business the applicant must show more than that it was sustained in the conduct of that business for to show only that is to establish what is perfectly consistent with the loss having arisen from his own misguided management decisions or even total neglectI agree with this reasoningThe applicants state that  records up to 22 March 2005 are in the possession of the respondents already and are not required to be discovered by the applicants  the applicants do not have records after 22 March 2005 but they may be with the AdministratorUnfortunately the respondents have not specifically indicated how these documents satisfy the criteria under by O 15 r 23 To the extent that the applicants are required to prove their case as explained by the Full Court in Netaf the rain data records appear to be documents which fall within r 23 The response of the applicants does not suggest a dispute that the documents are discoverableHowever the applicants have stated that these documents up to 22 March 2005 are already in the possession of the respondents This is not denied by the respondents In my view O 15 r 24 applies in this case It is difficult to know what further could be achieved by requiring the applicants to discover the documentsHowever the respondents in relation to documents between 22 March 2005 and 23 June 2005 also claim that the documents are relevant to loss or damage claimed by the second and third applicants as to causation and measure of loss The respondents rely on the Netaf case In my view these documents fall within the scope of O 15 r 23 and should be discovered by the applicants  Item 25 Third applicants orchard management plansThere does not appear to be any dispute that this document if it exists should be discovered The applicants claim however that they do not possess the document On the basis that as submitted by the respondents documents of that class are referred to in other documents discovered by the applicants in the circumstances the appropriate order is that the applicants advise the respondents whether the document is in their custody or power and if it is the applicants should discover it  Items 26 27 and 28 Cash flows correspondence and emailsAs submitted by the respondents the applicants do not suggest that these documents are not discoverable On 5 July 2006 the applicants indicated that they were searching their records and would revert to the respondents shortly As at the hearing date of this matter it appears that they had not been discoveredIt does not appear that these items have been the subject of previous correspondence between the parties As a consequence of this there are few grounds submitted by the respondents as the basis of discovery and no responses from the applicants in relation to discovery of these documents To the extent that I can interpret the Schedule the only grounds submitted as a basis for discovery of these documents are  in relation to items 33 34 37 41 and 46 they are relevant to allegations in issue and reliance They will also lead to a train of inquiry which would advance the respondents case or damage the applicants case  there are no grounds asserted in relation to items 47 48 and 49  in relation to items 50 51 52 53 these classes of documents are relevant to

the applicants case Also see Netaf Pty Ltd v Bikane Pty Ltd 1990 92 ALR 490 at 494Other than in relation to the 100 day plan referred to in item 58 and in relation to which an order will be made it is not possible to identify whose documents these documents are I also note there is some duplication for example 2005 business plan in items 53 and 56 SHE plan in items 53 and 58 marketing plan in items 53 56 and 58 and communications plan in items 53 and 56Although the respondents have referred to the Netaf case in relation to a number of the items the relevance of the principle is not substantiated in relation to these items Further the train of inquiry test is applied in relation to all documents with the exception of items 47 48 49 and 57On the basis of the evidence before me I am not satisfied that an order for discovery is necessary in relation to any of these documentsI order that the time for service of this Notice of motion be abridged until a time no later than 400 pm 20 July

parol agreement discharges the earlier agreement it is not affected by the requirement that the original agreement be in writing In British and Beningtons Limited v North Western Cachar Tea Co Ltd 1923 AC 48 which concerned a contract required by the Statute of Frauds to be in writing Lord Atkinson said at 62   A written contract may be rescinded by parol either expressly or by the parties entering into a parol contract entirely inconsistent with the written one or if not entirely inconsistent with it inconsistent with it to an extent that goes to the very root of it  The earlier decision of the House of Lords in Morris v Baron  Co 1918 AC 1 also a Statute of Frauds case was relied upon154 It has been said as a general proposition that the result of varying the terms of an existing contract is to produce not the original contract with a variation but a new and different contract Williams v Moss Empires 1915 3 KB 242 at 247 Sankey J That approach was adopted by the Court of Appeal in Morris v Baron  Lord Sumner referred to it in British and Beningtons Ltd at 68 as possibly correct as a matter of formal logic However in United Dominions Corporation Jamaica Ltd v Shoucair 1969 1 AC 340 which was a case involving money lenders legislation in Jamaica Lord Devlin delivering the judgment of the House of Lords said at 348   The disadvantage of this view is that a minor variation may destroy the effect of the whole of the transaction between the parties The alternative view adopted by the House of Lords in Morris v Baron and again in British and Benningtons sic Ltd v NW Cachar Tea Company Ltd  is based on the intention of the parties They cannot have that which presumably they wanted that is the old agreement as amended so the court has to make up its mind which comes nearer to their intention to leave them with an unamended agreement or without any agreement at all The House answered this question by rejecting the strict view propounded by Sankey J and distinguishing between rescission and variation If the new agreement reveals an intention to rescind the old the old goes and if it does not the old remains in force and unamended  It seems that this distinction was developed in order to address the difficulties generated by requirements for contracts to be in writing imposed by the Statute of Frauds and in the United Dominions Corporation case by the Money Lending law of Jamaica155 In Tallerman  Co Pty Ltd v Nathans Merchandise Victoria Pty Ltd 1957 HCA 10  1957 98 CLR 93 Dixon CJ and Fullagar J described the distinction made between rescission and variation in the two House of Lords decisions as  not a satisfactory distinction It appeared to be a matter of degree at 113 Taylor J said at 144  It is firmly established by a long line of cases commencing at least as early as Goss v Lord Nugent 1833 5 B  Ad 58 and ending with cases such as Morris v Baron  Co and British  Beningtons Ltd v North Western Cachar Tea Co Ltd and indeed including Goss v Lord Nugent itself that the parties to an agreement may vary some of its terms by a subsequent agreement They may of course rescind the earlier agreement altogether and this may be done either expressly or by implication but the determining factor must always be the intention of the parties as disclosed by the later agreement156 Taylor J acknowledged that variation might involve partial rescission and cited Salmond and Williams on Contract  2 nd ed 1945 at 488 and 489   Partial rescission  does not completely destroy the contractual relation between the parties It merely modifies that relation by cutting out part of the rights and obligations involved therein with or without the substitution of new rights and obligations in their place Partial rescission is not the extinction of the contract but the variation of it  And further at 144   A contract may be varied 1 by way of partial rescission without the substitution of new terms in place of those rescinded or 2 by way of partial rescission with the substitution of new terms for those rescinded or 3 by the addition of new terms without any partial rescission at all  Taylor J observed that those passages correctly stated the accepted view of the manner in which an agreement by way of variation operates157 The distinction between rescission and variation of contracts was indirectly an issue in Dan v Barclays Australia Ltd 1983 46 ALR 437 57 ALJR 442 The case concerned the construction of the terms of a guarantee of the payment of up to 500000 owing under a bill acceptance facility which allowed for a maximum advance of 2 million The maximum of the bill acceptance facility was increased sometime after its execution It was held by Mason Brennan and Deane JJ that the initial bill acceptance facility was significantly different from that subsequently granted and the guarantors were therefore not liable for interest and charges resulting from default under the later facility although as a matter of construction of the guarantee they were liable for the principal up to the figure specified in the guarantee Wilson and Dawson JJ dissented In their dissent they observed that cases dealing with the circumstances in which variation of a contract would amount to rescission did not necessarily provide the answer to the question of the construction of the guarantee in its application to the facility However they said at 448  The distinction between rescission and variation is discussed in such cases as Tallerman  Co Pty Ltd v Nathans Merchandise Vic Pty Ltd 1957 HCA 10  1957 98 CLR 93 Morris v Baron and Co 1918 AC 1 and British and Beningtons Ltd v NW Cachar Tea Co 1923 AC 48 Variation of an existing contract whilst it in one sense always gives rise to a new contract does not always result in a substituted contract which in order to operate must necessarily rescind the contract which is varied Variation may take the form of rescission of some of the terms of an existing contract but if that is to have the effect of rescission of the whole contract the rescission must be express or by necessary implication and the determining factor must always be the intention of the parties as disclosed by contract when varied see Tallerman  Co Pty Ltd v Nathans Merchandise Vic Pty Ltd supra per Taylor J at 1434  Owen J in Permanent Building Society In Liquidation v Wheeler 1993 10 WAR 109 observed that although the statement in Dan was in a dissenting judgment the dissent related to the application of the test There was no reason to doubt the authoritative force of the statement of principle at 127    Many of the cases arise in the area of unenforceability due to noncompliance with a formal requirement such as writing  However the authorities show that the task is to ascertain the intention of the parties as embodied in the contracts  It was permissible in searching for the intention of the parties to look at the extent and completeness of the changes involved in the variation 127 His Honour said further at 128  That there may be as a matter of formal logic a new contract  is true to a limited extent only  In the Permanent Building Society case the parties had expressly confirmed the original agreement and made minor changes The varied contract was therefore a new contract only to the extent that it contained terms which were not present in the original agreement

of degree at 113 Taylor J said at 144  It is firmly established by a long line of cases commencing at least as early as Goss v Lord Nugent 1833 5 B  Ad 58 and ending with cases such as Morris v Baron  Co and British  Beningtons Ltd v North Western Cachar Tea Co Ltd and indeed including Goss v Lord Nugent itself that the parties to an agreement may vary some of its terms by a subsequent agreement They may of course rescind the earlier agreement altogether and this may be done either expressly or by implication but the determining factor must always be the intention of the parties as disclosed by the later agreement157 The distinction between rescission and variation of contracts was indirectly an issue in Dan v Barclays Australia Ltd 1983 46 ALR 437 57 ALJR 442 The case concerned the construction of the terms of a guarantee of the payment of up to 500000 owing under a bill acceptance facility which allowed for a maximum advance of 2 million The maximum of the bill acceptance facility was increased sometime after its execution It was held by Mason Brennan and Deane JJ that the initial bill acceptance facility was significantly different from that subsequently granted and the guarantors were therefore not liable for interest and charges resulting from default under the later facility although as a matter of construction of the guarantee they were liable for the principal up to the figure specified in the guarantee Wilson and Dawson JJ dissented In their dissent they observed that cases dealing with the circumstances in which variation of a contract would amount to rescission did not necessarily provide the answer to the question of the construction of the guarantee in its application to the facility However they said at 448  The distinction between rescission and variation is discussed in such cases as Tallerman  Co Pty Ltd v Nathans Merchandise Vic Pty Ltd 1957 HCA 10  1957 98 CLR 93 Morris v Baron and Co 1918 AC 1 and British and Beningtons Ltd v NW Cachar Tea Co 1923 AC 48 Variation of an existing contract whilst it in one sense always gives rise to a new contract does not always result in a substituted contract which in order to operate must necessarily rescind the contract which is varied Variation may take the form of rescission of some of the terms of an existing contract but if that is to have the effect of rescission of the whole contract the rescission must be express or by necessary implication and the determining factor must always be the intention of the parties as disclosed by contract when varied see Tallerman  Co Pty Ltd v Nathans Merchandise Vic Pty Ltd supra per Taylor J at 1434  Owen J in Permanent Building Society In Liquidation v Wheeler 1993 10 WAR 109 observed that although the statement in Dan was in a dissenting judgment the dissent related to the application of the test There was no reason to doubt the authoritative force of the statement of principle at 127    Many of the cases arise in the area of unenforceability due to noncompliance with a formal requirement such as writing  However the authorities show that the task is to ascertain the intention of the parties as embodied in the contracts  It was permissible in searching for the intention of the parties to look at the extent and completeness of the changes involved in the variation 127 His Honour said further at 128  That there may be as a matter of formal logic a new contract  is true to a limited extent only  In the Permanent Building Society case the parties had expressly confirmed the original agreement and made minor changes The varied contract was therefore a new contract only to the extent that it contained terms which were not present in the original agreement158 In Commissioner of Taxation v Sara Lee Household  Body Care Australia Pty Ltd 2000 HCA 35  2000 201 CLR 520 at 534 reference was made in the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ Gaudron McHugh and Hayne JJ to the passage from the judgment of Taylor J in Tallerman and its approval by Wilson and Dawson JJ in Dan  The joint judgment in Sara Lee said in relation to the passage from the judgment of Taylor J at 534 24  It accords with principle and with authority  Callinan J also acknowledged that there may be cases in which what is expressed to be a variation of an earlier agreement as a matter of construction cannot be so regarded162 A contract under which a person is employed whether directly or through a corporate entity controlled by that person may be discharged by sufficiently significant changes to the duties andor the remuneration of the person so employed A discharge will occur when the changes are significant not able to be accommodated by the terms of the original contract and not contemplated by the parties when the original contract was made Whether there has been a discharge or a variation of the original agreement depends upon the intention of the parties discerned by reference to the terms of their second agreement It is as Dixon CJ and Fullagar J said in Tallerman a matter of degree163 In my opinion Mr Elliotts appointment as managing director and chief executive officer of Energy on 29 September 2000 and Mr Brands relinquishment of that office was of itself sufficient to constitute a discharge of the Agreement of May 1999 There was a very substantial difference between the office of managing director and executive director which supports the contention that objectively judged it was the intention of both parties to discharge the Agreement The complete terms upon which Mr Brand provided his services as an executive director thereafter were never expressly agreed between Martech and Energy Those terms and conditions would have to be considered in the context of the evolving commercial relationship between Mr Brand and Energy and their respective conduct Mr Brand played a significant part in defining them himself not least by unilaterally varying downwards his annual fee164 I do not accept the submission by Martech that Mr Brand was removed from office by Energy on 29 September 2000 While the circumstances at the time made the course that he adopted the only practical course to take that was a judgment he made for himself and to which he assented I find that the Agreement was discharged consensually

06_1005.xml,c5,applied,Powell v Evreniades (1989) 21 FCR 252,23 Further to the statutory notion of serious hardship addressed in decisions referrable to the not dissimilarly framed provisions of the precursor s 265 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 Cth reliance was placed by the Tribunal upon this Courts decisions in Powell v Evreniades 1989 21 FCR 252 where Hill J made the following observations at 258260 in the context of the then Tax Relief Boards statutory discretion to release the trustee of a deceased persons estate wholly or in part from a taxation liability in the case of serious hardship    The Court will not subject a statement pursuant to s 13 of the Administrative Decisions Judicial Review Act 1977 Cth  to a fine analysis with a view to finding through a microscopic study of it some error of law   There is no definition in s 265 of what is meant by serious hardship nor would one expect there to be Each of the words in the phrase is an ordinary English word having a well understood meaning The context in which the words appear makes it clear that the Relief Board is to consider whether the exaction of the full amount of tax would involve the dependants of a deceased taxpayer in financial difficulty which in all the circumstances can be said to be serious it is obvious enough that what will constitute either will depend upon the circumstances of a given case   It is inappropriate to endeavour in the abstract to state tests of what will and what will not constitute serious hardship within the context of s 265 Clearly there would be severe financial hardship if the dependants of a deceased person were left destitute without any means of support That is not to say that in any particular case something less than that will not constitute serious hardship    it was open to the Board to conclude that the exaction of the full amount of  tax would cause serious hardship just as it was also open to the Board to conclude that exaction of the whole tax would not leave this applicant and her daughter in a situation that could properly be described as one of serious hardship The circumstances of the present case while clearly very close to the end of the spectrum representing destitution still come within that range of spectrum in which the decision could not be described as unreasonable in the Wednesbury sense that is to say unless consideration of some extraneous or irrelevant factor intervened to vitiate the decision    I can see no error of law in the way to which the Board so proceeded Understandably counsel for Mr Milne invoked as largely here applicable those observations of his Honour As I have already implied that precursor s 265 was expressed to require regard to be paid to the serious hardship which might otherwise affect a taxpayer in the event of an absence of intervention by way of release or partial release of income tax liability That precursor provision operated directly in favour of the dependants of a deceased taxpayer as well as a taxpayer but for present purposes the dictum of his Honour in Powell nevertheless provides a significant measure of assistance in relation to the operation of the present s 340 5 24 Further in his reasons for judgment in Powell at 263 Hill J referred to the dictum of Windeyer J in Giris Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation 1969 HCA 5  1969 119 CLR 365 at 384 concerning the need  to be guided and controlled by the policy and purpose of the enactment so far as that is manifest in it and to exclude from consideration any matter which it would be unlawful to take as a criterion subject to the qualification where the statute seems to allow great latitude to the Commissioner in forming his opinion  Moreover his Honour referred to what was said by Dixon J as he then was in R v Trebilco Ex parte FS Falkiner  Sons Ltd 1936 HCA 63  1936 56 CLR 20 at 32 as to certain statutory considerations by which an exercise of discretion is to be guided t he nature of those considerations to be gathered from the scope and object of the provision  Additionally his Honour referred further to dictum of Mason J as he then was in Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v PekoWallsend Ltd 1986 HCA 40  1986 162 CLR 24 at 40 where his Honour described the statutory discretion there addressed albeit not related to fiscal exaction as  similarly unconfined except in so far as there may be found in the subject matter scope and purpose of the statute some implied limitation on the factors to which the decisionmaker may legitimately have regard and where his Honour thereafter proceeded to emphasise that by analogy where the ground of review is that a relevant consideration has not been taken into account and the discretion is unconfined by the terms of the statute the court will not find that the decisionmaker is bound to take a particular matter into account unless an implication that he is bound to do so is to be found in the subject matter scope and purpose of the Act Those factors have aspects of materiality in relation to the issue or issues here falling for consideration25 Subsequently in Van Grieken v Veilands 1991 21 ATR 1639 Gummow J cited the principled approach outlined by Hill J in Powell with at least implicit approval observing that his Honour had further pointed out at 626 of Powell  that the decisionmaker was entitled to consider not only such matters as go to the issue of serious hardship but also other matters which in the discretion of the Board may be relevant56 In my opinion submissions propounded by the Commissioner which I have sought to outline in detail discretely or in the aggregate do not vitiate the conclusions of the Tribunal according to law The Tribunals conclusions were reasonably open for adoption being sufficiently founded upon evidentiary material bearing upon the critical statutory issue of serious hardship  including in particular the fraudulent conduct of Mr Milnes former partner in legal practice and its adverse effect upon Mr Milne financially and probably to at least an intangible extent professionally and the unsaleable character of the Brindabella property for the time being for the reasons I have earlier indicated It is of course necessary in that regard that the Commissioners challenge to the factual findings of the Tribunal should establish a viable footing according to principles of administrative law and the present appeal does not of course operate by way of a rehearing As I have foreshadowed I am unable to accept that the Commissioner has distilled administrative error in the juridical sense referrable to the reasoning and findings of the Tribunal being reasoning and findings which were rationally open for adoption in my opinion according to principles of administrative law and in particular in the light of the relevant evidentiary material placed before the Tribunal That material was consistent essentially with the conclusion that any enforced exaction of the outstanding income tax indebtedness of Mr Milne would cause serious hardship within the scope of that notion established for instance in Powell and subsequently in Van Grieken  and as continues in operation in the terms of operation of s 3405 of the Administration Act

consideration46 The Tribunals finding as to likely serious hardship was broadly contended by the Commissioner to be based on an hypothesis that caused the Tribunal to ignore matters that were relevant to the task required of it by s 3405 of the Administration Act those matters being the operation of the Bankruptcy Act  and also of the LP Act The context scope and object of s 3405 of the Administration Act was said by the Commissioner to have required the Tribunal to consider the matters that would or could affect the financial circumstances of Mr Milne in the light of his then current tax liability Accordingly so the Commissioners submissions continued for the Tribunal to fail to take into consideration matters such as the operation relevantly of those statutory provisions constituted a further error of law either by way of statutory misconstruction or failure to take into account relevant considerations due to statutory misconstruction or otherwise In that latter regard I was referred to Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v PekoWallsend Limited 1986 HCA 40  1986 162 CLR 24 in particular in relation to what appears in the reasons for judgment of Mason J as he then was at 39 under the heading Failure To Take Into Account a Relevant Consideration  Of course in circumstances where the Tribunal at least inherently or implicitly in the particular context the subject necessarily of consideration by the decisionmaker took into account relevant considerations and correspondingly took no account of irrelevant considerations so much would normally suffice to satisfy the requirements of administrative obligations47 The power under s 34053 was contended by the Commissioner in any event to require two matters in particular to be considered and determined first whether there would be serious hardship to Mr Milne in the circumstances postulated  and secondly whether in all the circumstances otherwise prevailing the Commissioner ought to have exercised the statutory discretion to release Mr Milnes subject taxation liability In considering the first of those issues it was contended by the Commissioner that the Tribunal addressed what it considered to be the socalled test of foreseeability and control presumably thereby referring to the circumstances in which Mr Milne came to have incurred the subject tax liabilities in the first place The second consideration was described in terms as to whether the release of Mr Milne if granted would be fair to others whatever the implications of that broad description The Tribunal was said by the Commissioner to have considered that in circumstances where a person had earnt a high level of income in the past and was continuing to earn a high income special factors were necessary in order to establish serious hardship The description high income is in any event somewhat unspecific to be necessarily helpful The Tribunal found that Mr Milnes battle to continue his professional work  despite illhealth and his need to support his dependent son until he finished school were special factors 48 The approaches of the Tribunals reasoning leading to its decisionmaking were attacked by the Commissioner as wrong in that it was said to have misunderstood the meaning of serious hardship as a socalled backward looking matter rather than a matter that turned on an objective analysis of the future On a proper understanding of that statutory term questions as to special factors were said not to arise In particular the Commissioner asserted that a taxpayers struggle to continue working was simply irrelevant but for what it may ultimately matter I do not think that somewhat simplistic description sufficiently reflects the complexity of circumstances that the Tribunal explicitly and implicitly took into account in relation to Mr Milne49 Addressing a further basis advanced by the Commissioner for the present administrative review sought it was contended that on a proper understanding of the twotiered test in subs 34053 of the Administration Act no reasonable Tribunal could have exercised the statutory discretion to release Mr Milne from his taxation liability Reference was made by the Commissioner in that regard to the grant of administrative relief made available in Parramatta City Council v Pestell 1972 HCA 59  1972 128 CLR 305 which related to a local Councils imposition of a rate because of the special benefit flowing from the Councils execution of a particular work or service on public property and which the High Court affirmed to be invalid It was argued by the Commissioner conversely that the factual circumstances of a high income earner having substantial assets sufficient in value to meet all current liabilities could not reasonably fall within the statutory notion of serious hardship  It is normally a formidable task to establish that the decision of an administrative decisionmaker satisfies that test of invalidity The Commissioner advanced the further case that the exercise of the Tribunals power to release Mr Milne was unreasonable in that on the evidence placed before it no reasonable person could have come to the conclusions reached by the Tribunal in its decision the subject of appeal I was referred again to PekoWallsend where at 41 Mason J discussed the scope of the principle of Wednesbury unreasonableness I would make a similar observation upon that submission to that which I have made in relation to satisfaction of the test in Pestell

06_1005.xml,c10,discussed,Re Drake and Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (No. 2) (1979) 2 ALD 634,34 I was next referred by the Commissioner to the assistance to be gained from government statements of policy as outlined by Brennan J then a member of the Tribunal in Re Drake and Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs No 2 1979 2 ALD 634 at 640 and in particular the following  There are powerful considerations in favour of a Minister adopting a guiding policy It can serve to focus attention on the purpose which the exercise of the discretion is calculated to achieve and thereby to assist the Minister and others to see more clearly in each case the desirability of exercising the power in one way or another Decisionmaking is facilitated by the guidance given by an adopted policy and the integrity of decisionmaking in particular cases is the better assured if decisions can be tested against such a policy By diminishing the importance of individual predilection an adopted policy can diminish the inconsistencies which might otherwise appear in a series of decisions and enhance the sense of satisfaction with the fairness and continuity of the administrative process I draw attention in particular to his Honours reference to the guidance given by an adopted policy  Of course the operations of that policy in relation to contemporary values may be a matter of difficulty when it comes to making a judgment in particular cases35 Upon the footing of what was described as those guiding principles and rulings the Commissioner contended that the Tribunal misapplied or misinterpreted the statute in relation to the facts proved since the present was not a case so it was emphasised where Mr Milnes financial difficulty was such that either he or his dependants would be  in significant need warranting action to relieve their condition those words cited appearing at 24 of the Tribunals decision The difficulty with that observation of generality lies in its application and in particular in relation to Mr Milnes family exigencies as well as those of his own personally involving as they do the need for reasonable accommodation for himself and apparently for two or at least the youngest of his three children and completion of the education of that youngest child36 The Commissioner contended that in dealing with the issue of serious hardship  the Tribunal fell into error in that the Tribunal  i failed to consider whether Mr Milne had sufficient equity in his assets to discharge all of his liabilities including the debt due to the Commissioner without bankruptcy and relied instead upon the statement of assets and liabilities provided by Mr Milne in September 2004 which however referred to his assets but not his liabilities that material was said by the Commissioner to have demonstrated an excess of assets over liabilities of 409800 and although Mr Milne subsequently provided an updated statement of assets and liabilities showing his financial position as of November 2004 see in that regard what I have already reproduced in 8 above nevertheless on the basis of that statement of assets and liabilities there was available equity in the sum of 199200 to discharge a tax debt of 14987668   ii failed to take into account adequately or at all whether Mr Milne or his dependants would be deprived in reality of necessities according to normal community standards in that regard it was said by the Commissioner that Mr Milne was in the position at least for the foreseeable future to earn significant income to provide for the necessities of life for one or perhaps two dependent children as well as himself both the financial statement provided by Mr Milne to the Tribunal on 30 September 2004 and his updated financial information were further said to have demonstrated that just under one half of his estimated fortnightly expenses would be expended in mortgage payments if the mortgage was to be discharged upon the sale of the properties at Eastwood and Brindabella then on Mr Milnes own figures there would be a fortnightly income surplus even assuming the payment of a reasonable amount for rent on account of alternative accommodation whatever that might be and  iii concentrated exclusively on what income Mr Milne required to survive on the assumption that he retained all of his assets yet according to the Commissioner there were a number of errors inherent in that approach in that  a if Mr Milnes level of expenditure remained approximately the same and whether or not he was required to pay the amount due to the Commissioner then absent the sale of his assets he would face bankruptcy yet relief of his income tax liability would not alleviate that plight but would give preference to other creditors   b no or no proper regard was paid by the Tribunal to the extent of Mr Milnes assets generally and   c on Mr Milnes own case some time within the next three years or so he would cease to work in such an event he would have no income and in order to discharge other creditors he would be required to sell his assets in any event40 The implications of all that were said by the Commissioner to be as follows   i Division 4B of Part VI of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 Cth came into force on 1 July 1992 by virtue of the Bankruptcy Amendment Act 1991 Cth and the objects of Division 4B of Part VI appear in s 139J as follows     a to require a bankrupt who derives income during the bankruptcy to pay contributions towards the bankrupts estate and         b to enable the recovery of certain money and property for the benefit of the bankrupts estate      ii in general terms that Division provides for the trustee to assess the amount of a bankrupts income in each successive year of the bankruptcy and may establish a liability on the part of the bankrupt pursuant to an income tax assessment to make a contribution out of an excess of income assessed over a specified threshold  iii the threshold amount is defined in terms of the maximum basic rate of pension payable under the Social Security Act 1991 Cth  iv the liability of a bankrupt to pay a contribution pursuant to his or her trustees assessment is imposed by s 139P1 of the Bankruptcy Act  which provides    Subject to s 139Q  if the income that a bankrupt is likely to derive during a contribution assessment period as assessed by the trustee under an original assessment exceeds the actual income threshold amount applicable in relation to the bankrupt when that assessment is made the bankrupt is liable to pay to the trustee a contribution in respect of that period     v section 139P2 of the Bankruptcy Act provides for voluntary contributions where the assessed income falls below the threshold amount s 139Q thereof imposes a liability to pay a contribution in respect of a contribution assessment period where the trustee has made a subsequent assessment which exceeds the actual income threshold amount  vi the contribution payable by a bankrupt pursuant to that assessment process is defined in s 139S of the Bankruptcy Act as follows    The contribution that a bankrupt is liable to pay in respect of a contribution assessment period is the amount worked out in accordance with the formula   Assessed incomeActual income threshold amount  2   where   Assessed income means the amount assessed by the trustee to be the income that the bankrupt is likely to derive or derived during the contribution assessment period   Actual income threshold amount means the actual income threshold amount assessed by the trustee to be applicable in relation to the bankrupt when the assessment is made     vii the foregoing concept of actual income threshold amount is further defined in s 139K on a sliding scale increased according to the number of dependents that the bankrupt has and the extent of their dependency the base income threshold amount is defined in s 139K for a particular time as the amount that at that time is specified in column 3 item 2 Table B point 1064B1 Pension Rate Calculator A in the Social Security Act 1991  multiplied by 35   viii in the present case because Mr Milne has more than two dependents the base income threshold amount is increased by 27 s 139Kc and  ix once Mr Milne became bankrupt he would be liable to contribute 50 of the difference between his actual income as assessed by the trustee and the base income threshold amount so increased by 27 according to the Commissioners calculations upon the basis of an assessable annual income of 9000000 and two dependent children the formula in s 139K of the Bankruptcy Act required an annual contribution of 2995856 or a fortnightly contribution of 115225 being less than half of Mr Milnes fortnightly mortgage payments41 Significantly therefore so the Commissioner submitted Division 4B of the Bankruptcy Act contains within it a mechanism to determine a higher income threshold in cases of hardship pursuant to s 139T1 of the Bankruptcy Act  where the trustee has made an assessment of a contribution that a bankrupt is liable to pay and that bankrupt considers that if required to make any such contribution he or she would suffer hardship emphasised by the Commissioner incidentally to be not serious hardship  for any reason or reasons set out in subs 139T2 then the bankrupt may apply to the trustee for the making of a determination The reasons which might be operative in the favour of Mr Milne if made bankrupt were said to be found within subparagraphs ae of s 139T2  which read as follows   a the bankrupt or the dependent of a bankrupt suffers from an illness or disability that requires ongoing medical attention and the supply of medicines and the bankrupt is required to meet a substantial proportion of the costs of that medical attention or those medicines from his or her income       b the bankrupt is required to make payments from his or her income to meet the cost of child day care to enable the bankrupt to continue in employment or other work   c the bankrupt is living in rented accommodation that is not provided by or by an authority of the Commonwealth a State or a Territory or by a local government authority and the bankrupt is required to pay the cost of that accommodation wholly or mainly from his or her income   d the bankrupt incurs substantial expense in travelling to and from the bankrupts place of employment or other work whether by public transport or otherwise   e the spouse of the bankrupt or another person residing with the bankrupt who ordinarily contributes to the cost of maintaining the bankrupts household has become unable to contribute to those costs because of unemployment illness or injury42 In summary it was contended by the Commissioner that the Tribunal failed to consider all of the socalled true effects which bankruptcy would have had on Mr Milne

06_1005.xml,c13,referred_to,Parramatta City Council v Pestell [1972] HCA 59 ; (1972) 128 CLR 305,49 Addressing a further basis advanced by the Commissioner for the present administrative review sought it was contended that on a proper understanding of the twotiered test in subs 34053 of the Administration Act no reasonable Tribunal could have exercised the statutory discretion to release Mr Milne from his taxation liability Reference was made by the Commissioner in that regard to the grant of administrative relief made available in Parramatta City Council v Pestell 1972 HCA 59  1972 128 CLR 305 which related to a local Councils imposition of a rate because of the special benefit flowing from the Councils execution of a particular work or service on public property and which the High Court affirmed to be invalid It was argued by the Commissioner conversely that the factual circumstances of a high income earner having substantial assets sufficient in value to meet all current liabilities could not reasonably fall within the statutory notion of serious hardship  It is normally a formidable task to establish that the decision of an administrative decisionmaker satisfies that test of invalidity The Commissioner advanced the further case that the exercise of the Tribunals power to release Mr Milne was unreasonable in that on the evidence placed before it no reasonable person could have come to the conclusions reached by the Tribunal in its decision the subject of appeal I was referred again to PekoWallsend where at 41 Mason J discussed the scope of the principle of Wednesbury unreasonableness I would make a similar observation upon that submission to that which I have made in relation to satisfaction of the test in Pestell 
06_1017.xml,c0,referred_to,Spencer v The Commonwealth (1907) 5 CLR 418,To arrive at the value of property on a particular date it is necessary to make a judgment as to the price at which the property would be sold on that date by voluntary bargaining between a seller and a buyer willing to trade but neither of whom is so anxious to do so that the buyer or seller would overlook any ordinary business consideration The judgment must be made on the assumption that both buyer and seller are perfectly acquainted with the property and cognisant of all circumstances that might affect its value either advantageously or prejudicially Having placed itself in the position of such parties at the relevant date the question for the decision maker to determine is the point at which the buyer and seller would meet that is to say the aim is to determine the sum that the buyer would be willing to pay and the price that the seller would be prepared to take see Spencer v The Commonwealth 1907 HCA 70  1907 5 CLR 418 at 441 So much is undoubted
06_1017.xml,c1,referred_to,Teh v Ramsay Centauri Pty Ltd [2002] NSWSC 456,However the first question that arises in the present context is to determine just what is to be valued Section 667C refers to  the company as a whole  That phrase signifies the overall enterprise or undertaking of the relevant company in the sense of the whole of its assets and its liabilities as a going concern or as a cohesive collection of resources organised so as to produce a return through outlay Attention is directed at the sum of the component parts viewed as a productive organisational whole and not at any particular asset or advantage see Teh v Ramsay Centauri Pty Ltd 2002 NSWSC 456 at 13 In particular the phrase does not direct attention to the value of particular share capital of the relevant company On the other hand dealings in the share capital of a company may give considerable assistance in the task of determining the value of that company as a wholeThe date as at which the value is to be determined is the date at which the 90 holder gives the relevant compulsory acquisition notice It is at that point that the 90 holder initiates the process for compulsory acquisition The holders of the shares that are to be subject to acquisition are drawn into a relationship with the 90 holder whether they like it or not by the operation of the Act see Teh v Ramsay Centauri at 28The EY Report did not directly address the question of the value of the Company as a whole in the terms just outlined The EY Report referred expressly to the provisions of s 667C1 and referred to Practice Note 43 issued by the Commission which provides guidance on possible valuation methodologies for an expert to consider However notwithstanding the express reference to s 667C1 the EY Report adopted the approach of valuing the ordinary shares and the preference shares in the Company and then aggregating those values to arrive at the value of the Company as a whole While ultimately the result of such an exercise may be helpful that does not appear to me to be the approach called for by the terms of s 667CThe Company operates in the newspaper printing and publishing industry in Australia The EY Report began with an overview of that industry followed by a profile of the Company The core operating activity of the Company is publishing  The Advocate  a regional daily newspaper based in Burnie Tasmania The Company also operates a printing business which prints The Advocate as well as undertaking general printing for third parties The Company also has a 40 per cent interest in The Examiner Newspaper Pty Ltd which publishes  The Examiner  a newspaper based in Launceston Tasmania
06_1017.xml,c2,referred_to,Winpar Holdings Ltd v Austrim Nylex Ltd [2005] VSCA 211,I do not consider that an addition for the special value identified in the EY Report is appropriate having regard to the language of s 667C As I have said the first step requires the determination of the value as at the date of the compulsory acquisition notice of the Company as a whole in the sense indicated above It is impermissible in determining fair value to make any allowance for synergies to be achieved by the acquisition It is equally impermissible in determining fair value to take into account special benefits deriving from full ownership see Winpar Holdings Ltd v Austrim Nylex Ltd 2005 VSCA 211 at 35 I have taken some trouble to deal with Ernst  Youngs opinion in some detail since for the reasons I have indicated I consider that it adopts an inappropriate approach However neither defendant suggested that such an inappropriate approach invalidated the process That is to say they accepted that it is a matter for the Court on the basis of the evidence before it which was limited to the Experts Report to determine whether Regional has established that 250 per preference share gives shareholders a fair value for the preference sharesThe defendants advanced arguments concerning the basis upon which the socalled special value should be allocated between ordinary shares and preference shares The contention appears to be that Regional is a buyer of preference shares and the present holders apart from Regional are sellers of preference shares They suggested that it is necessary to allocate the special value of 14 million identified by Ernst  Young between Regional on the one hand and preference share holders who include Regional on the other hand Something in the order of half and half was suggested as appropriate The contention appears to be that that exercise should be undertaken as part of the allocation of the value of the Company as a whole between the two classes of shares

06_102.xml,c10,discussed,Re Korda; in the matter of Stockford Ltd [2004] FCA 1682 ; (2004) 140 FCR 424,16 The decision of Finkelstein J in Re Korda in the matter of Stockford Ltd 2004 FCA 1682  2004 140 FCR 424  Stockford  drew attention to some issues relating to the fixing of the remuneration of administrators and has indirectly led to the present proceeding Finkelstein J said at 5  Although s 449E requires the remuneration to be fixed by the creditors or the court the section does not specify how it is to be fixed It could be fixed as a periodic salary a lump sum a percentage of some amount such as the value of the companys assets under the administrators control or according to the amount of time spent by the administrator determined by reference to a scale or formula The matter is simply left at large So also is the basis upon which the quantum of the remuneration is to be determined That is the section is silent on the factors to be taken into account both for deciding the appropriate method of fixing an administrators remuneration and in determining the amount to be fixed The only guidance that is given and it is given by necessary implication is that an administrator is entitled to reasonable remuneration That offers little assistance to the tribunal that is required to decide what is reasonable in a particular case17 It will be observed that the reference to reasonable remuneration is a gloss upon the words of the Act and is described by his Honour as arising from necessary implication That implication may no doubt be given effect to in the operation of s 449E2 but is of doubtful relevance to the construction of s 449E1 There is much else of relevance in the judgment in Stockford which is too lengthy to reproduce but some other passages repay reproduction His Honour said at 24 and 30 31  The natural meaning of the word fix in the context of an entitlement to such remuneration as is fixed by a resolution of creditors is so it seems to me to quantify that remuneration that is to calculate or ascertain the amount of remuneration Mayne v Jaques 1960 HCA 23  1960 101 CLR 169 173 174 180 See also In re Gallard Ex parte Harris 1892 1 QB 532 544 Thus remuneration will be fixed if it is stated as a money sum or is based on a formula which is capable of being applied according to some objective standard so the sum can be calculated or ascertained definitely Fraser Henleins v Cody 1945 HCA 49  1945 70 CLR 100 128 In the case of a formula all the objective elements must be identified Other cases which support this approach in related contexts include in Canada Hill v State 1913 14 DLR 158 163 Beuregard v The Queen in right of Canada 1983 148 DLR 3d 205 235 Royal Bank of Canada v Bjorklund 1985 36 Man R 2d 54 59 and in the United States Zimmerman v Carfield 42 Ohio St 463 468 1885 Board of Supervisors of Yavapai County v Stephens 177 P 261 262 1919 Culberson v Watkins 119 SE 319 322 1923 Woodcock v Dick 222 P 2d 667 669 1950 Powers v Isley 183 P 2d 880 884 1974    The question arises whether the approval of prospective fees charged on a time basis amounts to fixing or determining the liquidators remuneration On one view such approval does no more than fix the rate at which remuneration is to be charged as the method sets no limit to the amount to be charged it may not fix the remuneration At least there must be real doubt about the validity of the practice It is not however a matter which I need resolve for the issue does not arise squarely on the facts and no submissions were directed to the question To reach a concluded view would require consideration of among other things the knowledge of the practice by Parliament when the Companies Acts were reenacted or amended If Parliament knew of the practice and did not change the statute that is relevant to its interpretation I should say that if the practice be irregular that would not mean that a liquidator must complete his administration before he receives any remuneration He could be allowed interim remuneration while work is being performed leaving the precise amount of his remuneration to be fixed when the winding up is complete In any event the problem may not be as large as at first it seems Oftentimes especially in a complex administration it will be too difficult to fix fees prospectively having regard to the matters that should be taken into account as I will later explain For this reason courts have from time to time refused to fix fees prospectively for instance Re Daily Telegraph Newspaper Company Limited 1931 48 WN NSW 236  Be that as it may whatever be the correct meaning of fixing remuneration it was not fixed in this case The resolutions purporting to fix the administrators remuneration did so by reference to the rates in the administrators report According to those rates work performed by persons occupying the same position could attract a different hourly charge There was no criteria by reference to which one could determine which hourly charge would be applied In reality it was left to the administrators to decide what the rate would be In this state of affairs it was the administrators and not the creditors who fixed their remuneration  emphasis added18 Finkelstein J did not decide the point at issue here in Stockford  It is also notable that much of the discussion in Stockford related not so much to the question of whether fees are fixed but whether the fees if fixed are reasonable20 It is submitted for the plaintiff that the resolutions in the present case do not suffer from the defect which existed in Stockford as there is only one rate fixed for each person who does any work in connection with the administration Once the person and his or her category is known and the time spent is known the guide can be arithmetically applied to arrive at the result Thus the resolution here does avoid one of the problems which brought down the arrangement in Stockford  Counsel also relied upon the specific monetary limits or caps to avoid the criticism that the arrangements would otherwise be open ended

06_1027.xml,c7,referred_to,NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (1996) 71 FCR 285,62 I start by reminding myself of some wellknown general principles relevant to the fixing of pecuniary penalties What follows is taken from the reasons for judgment of Burchett and Keifel JJ in NW Frozen Foods v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission 1996 71 FCR 28563 First the effect of the respondents conduct on the function of markets and other economic effects of the conduct will generally be regarded as a significant matter and the court is likely to be assisted by views put forward by the Commission or by experts called on behalf of the parties at 290 In this case the Commission put forward no direct evidence as to the effects of the respondents conduct on the function of the relevant market64 Secondly deterrence both general and personal is important in assessing the appropriate penalty It has been described as a principal purpose of s 76 and a factor of particular significance see the cases referred to at 293 However at the same time it is important that the penalty imposed is not oppressive65 Thirdly cooperation and the implementation of a compliance programme by the contravener is also an important matter in fixing the appropriate penalty Burchett and Keifel JJ said at 294  Where the Commission established to administer the Act is satisfied that an appropriate programme has been undertaken or the undertaking of it is proved to the Court this is the most important matter to take into account on penalty66 Fourthly the penalties imposed in one case cannot dictate the appropriate penalty in another case That follows from the fact that the circumstances in two cases are rarely the same or equal67 The fifth point is perhaps an observation more than anything else Burchett and Keifel JJ expressed the view that the penalties imposed by s 76 are not criminal sanctions and their purpose established now by a long line of cases is not punishment at 296297 Carr J on the other hand considered that the question was an open one at 29968 Section 76 identifies four matters which are relevant to the determination of the appropriate pecuniary penalty They are  1 the nature and extent of the act or omission 2 the loss or damage suffered as a result of the act or omission 3 the circumstances in which the act or omission took place and    4 whether the contravening company and accessory have been found guilty of previous relevant contraventions70 The above matters are not exhaustive of all the relevant circumstances NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission supra per Burchett and Keifel JJ at 292 Other factors have also been identified such as the respondents financial position and any profit made by the contravening company A number of the matters overlap and clearly the significance or weight to be accorded to any particular matter will depend on the circumstances of the particular case71 As to the nature and extent of the acts constituting the contravening conduct in the case of Pete N Peppa I have found that there were eight acts which contravened s 48 of the Act Those acts occurred over a period of about 16 months and the conduct culminated in the withholding of supply of Cambur products In the case of Tabletop and Kitchen there were four acts which contravened s 48 Those acts occurred over a period of about threeandahalf years from January 2002 to July 2005 during which time as a result of the respondents conduct Tabletop and Kitchen did not discount Cambur products72 As to any loss or damage suffered as a result of the contravening conduct there are two groups which may have suffered loss or damage and they are the retailers and consumers There is no precise evidence of loss or damage suffered by either group As far as retailers are concerned it was suggested that retailers other than Pete N Peppa or Tabletop and Kitchen may have been induced not to discount Certainly there is evidence to suggest Mr Caulfield was speaking to other retailers about the price of Cambur products but I do not think that I could find on the evidence that other retailers suffered loss or did not discount so that they or consumers suffered loss and damage Mr Milosevic of Pete N Peppa gives some general evidence of loss and damage suffered by Pete N Peppa when he says that the Bamix and Magimix products were the best on the market and Pete N Peppa lost money because they were not selling them and were sending customers to other stores There is no evidence from Mr Mitchell or Ms Gilbert of Tabletop and Kitchen of the effect of the contravening conduct on the business of Tabletop and Kitchen I am prepared to assume that some loss was suffered by Pete N Peppa and Tabletop and Kitchen but I can be no more precise than that The conduct in each case occurred over a considerable period of time and Bamix and Magimix products were popular in the marketplace Both businesses sought to discount the products As far as the effect on consumers is concerned I am prepared to assume that some loss and damage was caused because consumers could not buy discounted Cambur products from Pete N Peppa and Tabletop and Kitchen

06_1042.xml,c0,applied,Jess v Scott (1986) 12 FCR 187,The first issue was the factor of expiration of eight years since her Honours decision was handed down in this Court which was acknowledged by counsel for the applicant to be an extraordinarily long time Discussion was undertaken by the parties of the implications of the Full Federal Court decision in Jess v Scott 1986 12 FCR 187 made on 4 November 1986 where it was held by a Full Federal Court Lockhart Sheppard and Burchett JJ that an extension of time should be granted in the context of that litigation and in relation to which because of a misunderstanding on the part of the solicitor for the intending appellant as to the date of delivery of the judgment sought to be appealed the notice of appeal was filed and served on the day next following the last day limited by the Federal Court Rules for appeal The Federal Court Rules then required and still do the establishment of special reasons for leave to file and serve an appeal outside the requisite period of 21 days Order 52 Rule 15 In the joint judgment of the Full Court at 195196 in Jess  the following appears   What is needed to justify an extension of time is that there be shown a special reason why the appeal should be permitted to proceed though filed after the expiry of twentyone days the expression special reasons is intended to distinguish the case from the usual course according to which is the time twentyone days But it may be so distinguished not necessarily will for the rule gives a discretion wherever the Court sees a ground which does justify departure from the general rule in the particular case Such a ground is a special reason because it takes the case out of the ordinary We do not think that the use of the expression for special reasons implies something narrower than this          In the circumstances of the present case we formed the view that there were plainly special reasons which justified the making of the order soughtThe special reasons sought here to be so established by the applicant were purportedly founded upon the history of the steps which were taken by him up to the time of the hearing before OConnor J back in June 1998 In any event it was conceded by counsel for the applicant that the principle of Anshun estoppel may apply but it was contended nevertheless that there were special circumstances in this case which would permit me to exercise my discretion to allow the matter to proceed including the asserted circumstances that the applicant did not have legal representation at the hearing before her Honour at least for the reason that he could not afford legal representation and further that there will be no disadvantage to the Minister from the reagitation of these mattersThe second issue raised and sought to be addressed by the applicant related to the explanation for the delay The applicant explained that at all times since June 1998 he had been involved in court proceedings for the purpose of challenging the decision of the Tribunal of 30 December 1997 and asserted that he had not delayed in progressing the court proceedings although each proceeding has taken a long time to resolve due to factors beyond his controlI have not been presented with  something very persuasive indeed to justify a grant of leave  within the dicta cited in Jess  in order to appeal the decision of OConnor J The applicants delay in applying for leave to appeal the decision of OConnor J has been very lengthy in scope falling of course just short of eight years Moreover it is not without significance that the applicant decided in any event to pursue what the applicant evidently preferred or at least chose as another avenue of perceived redress by way of class action in another superior court of record The pursuit of that other avenue having ultimately failed I am unable to accept that there remains any viable alternative appellate redress by way of resort to an application for an extension of time to appeal the judgment of this Court delivered virtually eight years ago In my opinion no special reason has been made out for leave to appeal the judgment of OConnor J delivered on 10 June 1998 at least for the reason I have just indicted Moreover and in any event I have been unable to distil any conceivable error of law appearing in her Honours reasons for judgment that might conceivably offer a viable prospect of success on any appeal if leave for that purpose was to be grantedThe present application for an extension of time must therefore be dismissed  I

06_1042.xml,c1,referred_to,S1174 of 2002 v Refugee Review Tribunal [2004] FCA 289,In support of the contention of counsel for the applicant on the issue of delay I was referred to his involvement in the Muin and Lie class action and the circumstance that in February 2004 in the context of proceedings S1174 of 2002 v Refugee Review Tribunal 2004 FCA 289  Emmett J found at 2930 as follows    29 The second possible matter of prejudice was a concern that delay might be advanced as an answer to any claim for relief The Minister has assured the Court that she will not make a submission in any future proceeding that there is no satisfactory explanation for the applicants delay from the time when the applicant was joined as a representative party in the High Court to the time of refusal of an order nisi Any delay from the time of the making of a decision by the Tribunal and the joinder of the applicant in the High Court proceeding would still remain to be explained so would any delay from the time of refusal of an order nisi until the commencement of any fresh proceeding       30 I do not consider that there would be any prejudice to the applicant or to any of the other applicants by the refusal of an order nisi No such refusal would stand in the way of successful prosecution of any subsequent application for prerogative writ relief if properly commenced and particularisedThe applicant contended on that footing that this assurance given by the Ministers solicitor applies in the present case The Ministers response was that account needs to be taken of the context of the Ministers assurance being the existence of about 700 applications for order nisi remitted from the High Court to the Federal Court in S1174 of 2002 The Minister submitted that the assurance that no submission would be made in any future proceedings that there was no satisfactory explanation for the applicants delay from the time when the applicant was joined as a representative party in the High Court to the time of his Honours judgment was in respect of future first instance proceedings brought challenging the Tribunals decisionAssuming the foregoing explanations concerning involvement in the class action have some discrete basis in merit the fact remains that the applicants engagement in the class action occurred in the context of the unfavourable decision already entered against him by OConnor J and for whatever reasons of his own he chose to leave the adverse findings by her Honour unchallenged by way of appeal and to pursue whatever refugee status he might have in the context of that class action

been entitled to proceed to hearing on the Judiciary Act application For this reason the Court decided to vacate the dates set down for hearing the leave application and to reserve the question of leave arising under the ADJR Act to be determined simultaneously with the hearing of the amended application As a result of the orders of 1 August 2006 the future course of the proceedings has been substantially altered and both respondents now face a final hearing on the amended application Immediately after the orders of 1 August 2006 were made ACMA indicated that it would seek security for costs Additionally GCB indicated it wished to seek further security pursuant to leave granted in the orders arising from the May decision At that time PCR indicated it could unconditionally offer an additional 10000 security to the second respondent which has now also been paid The first respondent now seeks security in the sum of 36148 The second respondent seeks further security in the sum of approximately 60000 I consider that the cost estimates provided by the first and second respondents are realistic  FACTS   The relevant background is contained in the May decision The applications in the present case are made under s 56 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 Cth The power to order security for costs under s 1335 of the Corporations Act 2001 Cth has no application in the present case because PCR is an incorporated association and not a company The considerations to be taken into account on a security for costs application are set out in the May decision at 11 and I will proceed to consider the relevant considerations below  THE RISK THAT A COSTS ORDER COULD NOT BE SATISFIED   It has now been conceded by PCR that it is impecunious and I accept that is extremely unlikely that PCR would be able to meet a costs order made against it in these proceedings The affidavit of Sylvia Higgins President and Ethnic Liaison Officer of PCR establishes that her attempts to solicit donations for the purpose of security for costs have been completely unsuccessful Donors to PCR have indicated they have no desire to contribute funds which might assist ACMA or GCB The money which has already been paid by way of security has been supplied wholly from the personal assets of Ms Higgins and her evidence was that she could not afford to provide any further assistance to PCR  THE MERITS OF APPLICATION   Since the May decision further information has been provided which casts light upon the merits of the application The affidavit of Ms Higgins attaches two advices received from counsel in relation to the prospects of success of the application The first of these advices sets out at length the law relating to the administrative appeals and states that the criticisms made of ACMAs decision  do not point to any error capable of leading to relief being granted upon judicial review  The advice concludes   As presently instructed I do not think that there is any basis upon which a successful judicial review application could be mounted    PCR subsequently sought advice from another counsel The advice from the second counsel is brief Its final two paragraphs state   In our view the grounds upon which to have the decision set aside are not particularly strong In relation to a number of the errors a court may ultimately hold that these reasonably fall within the proper exercise of the discretion vested in the ABA ACMA and do not constitute errors of law   Notwithstanding these concerns there are nevertheless reasonable prospects of showing that the ABA fell into reviewable error and having the decision set aside It appears to me that the conclusion in the final paragraph is not entirely consistent with the advice in the preceding paragraph  Ms Higgins gave evidence that she considered the second advice to have been better as it considered all of the particular facts of the case Irrespective it appears that on the basis of the advice given to PCR the prospects of success of this application are at best weak Nonetheless these proceedings were commenced on the basis of the second advice Counsel for PCR made reference to a third advice which apparently preceded both of the advices set out above and suggested it was optimistic However the Court has no evidence of such advice Counsel for PCR indicated that the strongest point to be raised in PCRs claim was the fact that of 2080 letters which had been submitted to ACMA in support of GCBs application for the broadcasting licence only 300 to 400 were relevant to ACMAs decision and therefore only those letters should have been relied upon by ACMA The greater portion of the letters had been prepared before the incorporation of GCB and PCR submits should have been given no weight by ACMA Instead PCR submits ACMA relied upon all of the letters and on a plain reading of ACMAs decision they were a critical factor in its decision to award the licence to GCB The letters which predated GCBs incorporation were written in support of an associated entity namely a Christian broadcasting station operating in Newcastle It was the Newcastle entity which was the original applicant for the licence under dispute until an application by GCB was substituted PCR submits that ACMA found that the programmes offered by the Newcastle entity and GCB were different However GCB relies upon the statement by Wilcox J at 47 in the previous judicial review application relating to this licence see WyongGosford Progressive Community Radio Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority and Anor 2003 FCA 33  2003 125 FCR 560 In that paragraph Wilcox J states   The letter of the ABA ACMA dated 23 December 2002 indicates the ABA did take into account material originally filed by Newcastle The letter specifically refers to letters of support and these were all originally provided by Newcastle However I do not think this made the material irrelevant The letters of support mainly addressed the matter of program content they were supportive of Christian programs That was a theme common to the applications of both Newcastle and Gosford It was open to Gosford to adopt this material as support for its own application It was for the ABA to determine the extent if any to which it should be discounted because of its provenance   Since this is an interlocutory application I have not yet had an opportunity to fully consider the evidence However prima facie the above passage from Wilcox J answers the claim now being raised by PCR PCR has also raised an allegation of fraud in its amended application stating that the date upon many of the letters of support were deliberately removed when the letters were submitted to ACMA in order to conceal the fact that the letters were written at a time when GCB had not yet been incorporated GCB however says that although the date was missing from some letters there were over 800 other letters which predated GCBs incorporation from which the date was not removed I agree that this fact appears to be inconsistent with the allegations of fraud made by PCR Prima facie if this is the sole foundation upon which PCRs fraud claim rests it would seem to be made on a tenuous basis particularly since it is not clear that it was an error for ACMA to take the older letters into consideration in any event Given the above circumstances the Court considers that as presently formulated PCRs claim has little chance of success This can only be a preliminary opinion given that I am yet to see and consider the entirety of the evidence but nonetheless it is relevant to the consideration of the security for costs application  WHETHER THE LITIGATION WILL BE STIFLED BY AN ORDER   PCR has submitted and I accept that there is a risk that the litigation may be stifled if an order for security for costs is made and certainly if an order is made in any significant amount This is one factor which must weigh into the consideration whether the Court should order security  WHETHER THERE ARE THIRD PARTIES STANDING BEHIND PCR   PCR is a notforprofit association which is staffed by volunteers There are no shareholders or creditors who have a pecuniary interest in the outcome of this litigation Rather this litigation is being brought in the interests of a sector of the community whose needs were met by the radio broadcasts of PCR In Friends of Hinchinbrook Society Inc v Minister for Environment and Ors No 1 1996 69 FCR 1 Branson J stated at 21   The applicant is an incorporated association of persons concerned with the environment In one sense every association is a front for its members they stand behind it and may be assumed themselves to support the objectives of the association and generally speaking the associations actions in intended advancement of those objectives There is however in my view a very real difference between the relationship of a member of a nonprofit association formed to advance a public interest to the association of which he or she is a member and the relationship of a shareholder to the company in which he or she holds shares The benefit which a shareholder might expect to obtain from litigation conducted by a company will ordinarily be whether directly or indirectly financial Members of a nonprofit association will not ordinarily benefit financially from litigation initiated by the association The benefit which they might obtain from such litigation is likely to be constituted by intellectual or emotional satisfaction    I accept that the volunteer managers of PCR in these proceedings cannot be equated with shareholders  standing behind  a company In this sense I consider the case is distinguishable from Bell Wholesale Co Ltd v Gates Export Corporation 1984 2 FCR 1 at 4 However this does not absolve the volunteer managers from their duty to act responsibly in the conduct of litigation see the further discussion at 2831  below  DELAY   PCR submits that the application by ACMA has been made too late and that accordingly it should not be entitled to an order for security In Crypta Fuels Pty Ltd and Anor v Svelte Corporation Pty Ltd and Ors 1995 19 ACSR 68 at 71 Lehane J having been referred to numerous authorities noted that   Without referring in any greater detail to those authorities my conclusion from a consideration of them is that there is first and foremost a proposition accepted in every one of the cases which is that if an application for security for costs is to be made it must be made promptly   The application for security by ACMA was first raised when leave was granted to rely upon the amended application on 1 August 2006 ACMA has suggested that because of the change in the future course of the proceedings engendered by the filing of the amended application it was entitled to change its position on security for costs It says that when the proceedings were commenced ACMA faced only a leave application whereas now it faces a full hearing However there was always a possibility that leave would be granted to the ADJR Act application in which case ACMA would also have faced a full hearing I do not consider that if the leave application had been heard and allowed ACMA would then have been entitled to ask for security for costs at least not unless that application had been specifically foreshadowed at an early stage of proceedings By the time the leave application had been finalised PCR would have spent a substantial sum in legal costs A security for costs application at that point may have stifled the litigation and made all of the costs incurred up until that time redundant ACMA further submits that it is required to behave as a model litigant which requires among other things that it not take advantage of a claimant who lacks the resources to litigate a legitimate claim To the extent that ACMA relies upon the model litigant principles I do not consider that these principles would have precluded an application for security being brought at an earlier stage of the proceedings Those principles in my opinion aim to prevent ACMA bringing a security for costs application which is oppressive However an application brought on legitimate grounds earlier in these proceedings would not have been oppressive At the very least and particularly in circumstances where GCB brought an application for security it was incumbent upon ACMA to indicate at an early stage that it would apply for security if leave were granted ACMA has relied upon Gartner v Ernst  Young No 3 2003 FCA 1437 at 34  in which case an application made 10 months after the institution of proceedings was held not to be too late At 34 Mansfield J stated that   The proceedings were instituted in August 2002 The proceedings were complex There have been a number of versions of the statement of claim The bank is in terms of the substantive allegations made in the proceedings but a small player It foreshadowed bringing an application for security for costs at an early point It made such an application in May 2003 At that time the proceedings had not much progressed They were delayed by the accountants challenge to the entitlement of the corporate applicants to have instituted the proceedings in the circumstances and then the appeal of the accountants against that decision In practical terms the application has been unable to much progress until resolution of those issues I do not therefore consider that the bank has engaged in delay in instituting the present application or in maintaining it There is also nothing to persuade me that the elapse of time before this application has in any way caused unfairness to the applicants There is no evidence to suggest that     I consider that the present case can be distinguished from Gartner in two respects Firstly the application for security for costs was not foreshadowed at any early time despite the fact that GCB was bringing an application for security Secondly PCR has clearly already incurred considerable expense in the preparation of these proceedings An order for security to the extent that it may stifle the proceedings would result in the waste of this expenditure If the application had been brought or at least foreshadowed at an earlier stage PCR may have reconsidered its position and this expenditure may not have been incurred Accordingly I consider PCR would be prejudiced by an order at this stage of proceedings  OTHER MATTERS RELEVANT TO THE DISCRETION   There are several further matters which I consider to be relevant to the discretion to be exercised in this case There is a duty upon an impecunious applicant to act responsibly in pursuing litigation As Wilcox J said in Tobacco Control Coalition Inc v Philip Morris Australia Ltd 2000 FCA 1004 at 125    Those who litigate in the public interest need to be dedicated to their cause and enthusiastic in its pursuit But dedication and enthusiasm are not enough public interest claims also require strict professionalism with rigorous attention to any legal problems inherent in the proposed claim    PCR is funded by donors The evidence of Ms Higgins is that donors are unwilling to contribute funds which might be recovered in costs by the respondents It is clear that the volunteer managers of PCR are proceeding with the knowledge that PCR will not have funds to pay any adverse order for costs made against them Further PCR received two sets of legal advice which did not rate its chances of success highly One advice explicitly stated there was no reasonable prospect of success on this application As a result of these two factors the respondents are exposed to a significant financial risk For PCR to proceed in these circumstances is to demonstrate a lack of consideration for the detriment which may be suffered by the respondents The fact that an organisation is a notforprofit organisation does not give it free rein to bring proceedings no matter how tenuous the basis on which they are brought without any regard to the detriment which those proceedings may cause to the respondents There is a duty upon an applicant to be responsible in their conduct of litigation and to ensure that proceedings are not brought without regard to the prospects of success This duty must be strictly observed by an impecunious applicant who may bring proceedings in which irrecoverable costs may be incurred If PCR wishes to bring the proceedings despite advice that it does not have particularly strong grounds it is entitled to do so However it cannot expect that the respondents bear the risk of its choice by incurring costs which PCR knows cannot be recovered As noted by Branson J in The Airtourer Cooperative Ltd v Millicer Aircraft Industries Pty Ltd 2004 FCA 1400 at 33     the amount of security should be sufficient to ensure that the directors of the applicant appreciate that the risk that the applicant might be ordered to pay the respondents costs has more than notional significance    There is a second factor which I consider to be significant in the circumstances of this case This is not a matter in which the applicant is the only impecunious party GCB is also a notforprofit organisation and there is evidence to suggest that GCB may be unable to afford to defend these proceedings GCBs net operating profit for the last financial year was 696874 and its balance sheet shows that it has a total equity of 2739910 To date it has expended in excess of 42000 in this litigation and its estimates suggest it will spend another 50000 PCR says this is an unfortunate consequence of litigation which is not properly a consideration in ordering security for costs I disagree I consider that it is a relevant discretionary consideration that proceedings even if successfully defended may bankrupt a respondent especially in circumstances where there are grounds for doubting the merits of the application GCB has submitted that it would be of comfort in determining their future course to know that costs could be recovered if their defence was successful I accept that this is a valid consideration  CONCLUSION   Weighing all of the above factors I consider that further security should be provided to GCB but that no order should be made in favour of ACMA Bearing in mind my preliminary conclusions on the merits of this application the fact that GCB is itself a notforprofit organisation and the quantum of costs which are likely to be incurred I consider that GCB should be provided with further security in the sum of 30000 In determining this amount I am aware that there is a possibility that an order for security will force the applicant to withdraw from this litigation However this is only one factor to be taken into consideration There are many other factors weighing in favour of an order as outlined above In the circumstances I consider that the interests of justice require that GCB be given some further assurance of its costs if the application is unsuccessful although I have awarded a lesser amount than that sought by GCB in order to reduce the risk that the litigation will be stifled Because of the delay because ACMA is not a notforprofit organisation and because an additional award of security would further increase the likelihood that the litigation may be stifled I decline to grant security for costs to ACMA I propose to stage the payment of security in order to minimise the burden upon PCR so that security is paid in three equal monthly instalments before the

06_1043.xml,c1,referred_to,Crypta Fuels Pty Ltd and Anor v Svelte Corporation Pty Ltd and Ors (1995) 19 ACSR 68,On 26 May 2006 the Court delivered judgment in respect of a security for costs application made by the second respondent GCB see WyongGosford Progressive Community Radio Inc v Australian Communications and Media Authority 2006 FCA 625 the May decision Pursuant to that judgment the Court ordered that the applicant PCR pay security for the GCBs costs in the amount of 10000 The first respondent ACMA made no application for security for costs at this time At the time of the May decision the application before this Court was an application for leave to extend the time in which to file an application under the Administrative Decisions Judicial Review Act 1977 Cth ADJR Act However on 1 August 2006 the Court at the request of PCR granted leave to file an amended application in these proceedings The amended application included not only an application under the ADJR Act but also an application under s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 Cth  Judiciary Act  alleging the same errors of law as are contained in the draft ADJR Act application There is no time limit for the filing of an appeal under s 39B of the Judiciary Act  and so no leave was required to bring those proceedings Accordingly even if leave were not granted to file the ADJR Act application out of time

preliminary conclusions on the merits of this application the fact that GCB is itself a notforprofit organisation and the quantum of costs which are likely to be incurred I consider that GCB should be provided with further security in the sum of 30000 In determining this amount I am aware that there is a possibility that an order for security will force the applicant to withdraw from this litigation However this is only one factor to be taken into consideration There are many other factors weighing in favour of an order as outlined above In the circumstances I consider that the interests of justice require that GCB be given some further assurance of its costs if the application is unsuccessful although I have awarded a lesser amount than that sought by GCB in order to reduce the risk that the litigation will be stifled Because of the delay because ACMA is not a notforprofit organisation and because an additional award of security would further increase the likelihood that the litigation may be stifled I decline to grant security for costs to ACMA I propose to stage the payment of security in order to minimise the burden upon PCR so that security is paid in three equal monthly instalments before the commencement of the hearing  I certify that the preceding thirtysix 36 numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice

06_1043.xml,c2,referred_to,Friends of Hinchinbrook Society Inc v Minister for Environment and Ors (No 1) (1996) 69 FCR 1,On 26 May 2006 the Court delivered judgment in respect of a security for costs application made by the second respondent GCB see WyongGosford Progressive Community Radio Inc v Australian Communications and Media Authority 2006 FCA 625 the May decision Pursuant to that judgment the Court ordered that the applicant PCR pay security for the GCBs costs in the amount of 10000 The first respondent ACMA made no application for security for costs at this time At the time of the May decision the application before this Court was an application for leave to extend the time in which to file an application under the Administrative Decisions Judicial Review Act 1977 Cth ADJR Act However on 1 August 2006 the Court at the request of PCR granted leave to file an amended application in these proceedings The amended application included not only an application under the ADJR Act but also an application under s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 Cth  Judiciary Act  alleging the same errors of law as are contained in the draft ADJR Act application There is no time limit for the filing of an appeal under s 39B of the Judiciary Act  and so no leave was required to bring those proceedings Accordingly even if leave were not granted to file the ADJR Act application out of time PCR would have been entitled to proceed to hearing on the Judiciary Act application For this reason the Court decided to vacate the dates set down for hearing the leave application and to reserve the question of leave arising under the ADJR Act to be determined simultaneously with the hearing of the amended application As a result of the orders of 1 August 2006 the future course of the proceedings has been substantially altered and both respondents now face a final hearing on the amended application Immediately after the orders of 1 August 2006 were made ACMA indicated that it would seek security for costs Additionally GCB indicated it wished to seek further security pursuant to leave granted in the orders arising from the May decision At that time PCR indicated it could unconditionally offer an additional 10000 security to the second respondent which has now also been paid The first respondent now seeks security in the sum of 36148 The second respondent seeks further security in the sum of approximately 60000 I consider that the cost estimates provided by the first and second respondents are realistic  FACTS   The relevant background is contained in the May decision The applications in the present case are made under s 56 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 Cth The power to order security for costs under s 1335 of the Corporations Act 2001 Cth has no application in the present case because PCR is an incorporated association and not a company The considerations to be taken into account on a security for costs application are set out in the May decision at 11 and I will proceed to consider the relevant considerations below  THE RISK THAT A COSTS ORDER COULD NOT BE SATISFIED   It has now been conceded by PCR that it is impecunious and I accept that is extremely unlikely that PCR would be able to meet a costs order made against it in these proceedings The affidavit of Sylvia Higgins President and Ethnic Liaison Officer of PCR establishes that her attempts to solicit donations for the purpose of security for costs have been completely unsuccessful Donors to PCR have indicated they have no desire to contribute funds which might assist ACMA or GCB The money which has already been paid by way of security has been supplied wholly from the personal assets of Ms Higgins and her evidence was that she could not afford to provide any further assistance to PCR  THE MERITS OF APPLICATION   Since the May decision further information has been provided which casts light upon the merits of the application The affidavit of Ms Higgins attaches two advices received from counsel in relation to the prospects of success of the application The first of these advices sets out at length the law relating to the administrative appeals and states that the criticisms made of ACMAs decision  do not point to any error capable of leading to relief being granted upon judicial review  The advice concludes   As presently instructed I do not think that there is any basis upon which a successful judicial review application could be mounted    PCR subsequently sought advice from another counsel The advice from the second counsel is brief Its final two paragraphs state   In our view the grounds upon which to have the decision set aside are not particularly strong In relation to a number of the errors a court may ultimately hold that these reasonably fall within the proper exercise of the discretion vested in the ABA ACMA and do not constitute errors of law   Notwithstanding these concerns there are nevertheless reasonable prospects of showing that the ABA fell into reviewable error and having the decision set aside It appears to me that the conclusion in the final paragraph is not entirely consistent with the advice in the preceding paragraph  Ms Higgins gave evidence that she considered the second advice to have been better as it considered all of the particular facts of the case Irrespective it appears that on the basis of the advice given to PCR the prospects of success of this application are at best weak Nonetheless these proceedings were commenced on the basis of the second advice Counsel for PCR made reference to a third advice which apparently preceded both of the advices set out above and suggested it was optimistic However the Court has no evidence of such advice Counsel for PCR indicated that the strongest point to be raised in PCRs claim was the fact that of 2080 letters which had been submitted to ACMA in support of GCBs application for the broadcasting licence only 300 to 400 were relevant to ACMAs decision and therefore only those letters should have been relied upon by ACMA The greater portion of the letters had been prepared before the incorporation of GCB and PCR submits should have been given no weight by ACMA Instead PCR submits ACMA relied upon all of the letters and on a plain reading of ACMAs decision they were a critical factor in its decision to award the licence to GCB The letters which predated GCBs incorporation were written in support of an associated entity namely a Christian broadcasting station operating in Newcastle It was the Newcastle entity which was the original applicant for the licence under dispute until an application by GCB was substituted PCR submits that ACMA found that the programmes offered by the Newcastle entity and GCB were different However GCB relies upon the statement by Wilcox J at 47 in the previous judicial review application relating to this licence see WyongGosford Progressive Community Radio Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority and Anor 2003 FCA 33  2003 125 FCR 560 In that paragraph Wilcox J states   The letter of the ABA ACMA dated 23 December 2002 indicates the ABA did take into account material originally filed by Newcastle The letter specifically refers to letters of support and these were all originally provided by Newcastle However I do not think this made the material irrelevant The letters of support mainly addressed the matter of program content they were supportive of Christian programs That was a theme common to the applications of both Newcastle and Gosford It was open to Gosford to adopt this material as support for its own application It was for the ABA to determine the extent if any to which it should be discounted because of its provenance   Since this is an interlocutory application I have not yet had an opportunity to fully consider the evidence However prima facie the above passage from Wilcox J answers the claim now being raised by PCR PCR has also raised an allegation of fraud in its amended application stating that the date upon many of the letters of support were deliberately removed when the letters were submitted to ACMA in order to conceal the fact that the letters were written at a time when GCB had not yet been incorporated GCB however says that although the date was missing from some letters there were over 800 other letters which predated GCBs incorporation from which the date was not removed I agree that this fact appears to be inconsistent with the allegations of fraud made by PCR Prima facie if this is the sole foundation upon which PCRs fraud claim rests it would seem to be made on a tenuous basis particularly since it is not clear that it was an error for ACMA to take the older letters into consideration in any event Given the above circumstances the Court considers that as presently formulated PCRs claim has little chance of success This can only be a preliminary opinion given that I am yet to see and consider the entirety of the evidence but nonetheless it is relevant to the consideration of the security for costs application  WHETHER THE LITIGATION WILL BE STIFLED BY AN ORDER   PCR has submitted and I accept that there is a risk that the litigation may be stifled if an order for security for costs is made and certainly if an order is made in any significant amount This is one factor which must weigh into the consideration whether the Court should order security  WHETHER THERE ARE THIRD PARTIES STANDING BEHIND PCR   PCR is a notforprofit association which is staffed by volunteers There are no shareholders or creditors who have a pecuniary interest in the outcome of this litigation Rather this litigation is being brought in the interests of a sector of the community whose needs were met by the radio broadcasts of PCR In Friends of Hinchinbrook Society Inc v Minister for Environment and Ors No 1 1996 69 FCR 1 Branson J stated at 21   The applicant is an incorporated association of persons concerned with the environment In one sense every association is a front for its members they stand behind it and may be assumed themselves to support the objectives of the association and generally speaking the associations actions in intended advancement of those objectives There is however in my view a very real difference between the relationship of a member of a nonprofit association formed to advance a public interest to the association of which he or she is a member and the relationship of a shareholder to the company in which he or she holds shares The benefit which a shareholder might expect to obtain from litigation conducted by a company will ordinarily be whether directly or indirectly financial Members of a nonprofit association will not ordinarily benefit financially from litigation initiated by the association The benefit which they might obtain from such litigation is likely to be constituted by intellectual or emotional satisfaction    I accept that the volunteer managers of PCR in these proceedings cannot be equated with shareholders  standing behind  a company In this sense I consider the case is distinguishable from Bell Wholesale Co Ltd v Gates Export Corporation 1984 2 FCR 1 at 4 However this does not absolve the volunteer managers from their duty to act responsibly in the conduct of litigation see the further discussion at 2831  below  DELAY   PCR submits that the application by ACMA has been made too late and that accordingly it should not be entitled to an order for security In Crypta Fuels Pty Ltd and Anor v Svelte Corporation Pty Ltd and Ors 1995 19 ACSR 68 at 71 Lehane J having been referred to numerous authorities noted that   Without referring in any greater detail to those authorities my conclusion from a consideration of them is that there is first and foremost a proposition accepted in every one of the cases which is that if an application for security for costs is to be made it must be made promptly   The application for security by ACMA was first raised when leave was granted to rely upon the amended application on 1 August 2006 ACMA has suggested that because of the change in the future course of the proceedings engendered by the filing of the amended application it was entitled to change its position on security for costs It says that when the proceedings were commenced ACMA faced only a leave application whereas now it faces a full hearing However there was always a possibility that leave would be granted to the ADJR Act application in which case ACMA would also have faced a full hearing I do not consider that if the leave application had been heard and allowed ACMA would then have been entitled to ask for security for costs at least not unless that application had been specifically foreshadowed at an early stage of proceedings By the time the leave application had been finalised PCR would have spent a substantial sum in legal costs A security for costs application at that point may have stifled the litigation and made all of the costs incurred up until that time redundant ACMA further submits that it is required to behave as a model litigant which requires among other things that it not take advantage of a claimant who lacks the resources to litigate a legitimate claim To the extent that ACMA relies upon the model litigant principles I do not consider that these principles would have precluded an application for security being brought at an earlier stage of the proceedings Those principles in my opinion aim to prevent ACMA bringing a security for costs application which is oppressive However an application brought on legitimate grounds earlier in these proceedings would not have been oppressive At the very least and particularly in circumstances where GCB brought an application for security it was incumbent upon ACMA to indicate at an early stage that it would apply for security if leave were granted ACMA has relied upon Gartner v Ernst  Young No 3 2003 FCA 1437 at 34  in which case an application made 10 months after the institution of proceedings was held not to be too late At 34 Mansfield J stated that   The proceedings were instituted in August 2002 The proceedings were complex There have been a number of versions of the statement of claim The bank is in terms of the substantive allegations made in the proceedings but a small player It foreshadowed bringing an application for security for costs at an early point It made such an application in May 2003 At that time the proceedings had not much progressed They were delayed by the accountants challenge to the entitlement of the corporate applicants to have instituted the proceedings in the circumstances and then the appeal of the accountants against that decision In practical terms the application has been unable to much progress until resolution of those issues I do not therefore consider that the bank has engaged in delay in instituting the present application or in maintaining it There is also nothing to persuade me that the elapse of time before this application has in any way caused unfairness to the applicants There is no evidence to suggest that     I consider that the present case can be distinguished from Gartner in two respects Firstly the application for security for costs was not foreshadowed at any early time despite the fact that GCB was bringing an application for security Secondly PCR has clearly already incurred considerable expense in the preparation of these proceedings An order for security to the extent that it may stifle the proceedings would result in the waste of this expenditure If the application had been brought or at least foreshadowed at an earlier stage PCR may have reconsidered its position and this expenditure may not have been incurred Accordingly I consider PCR would be prejudiced by an order at this stage of proceedings  OTHER MATTERS RELEVANT TO THE DISCRETION   There are several further matters which I consider to be relevant to the discretion to be exercised in this case There is a duty upon an impecunious applicant to act responsibly in pursuing litigation As Wilcox J said in Tobacco Control Coalition Inc v Philip Morris Australia Ltd 2000 FCA 1004 at 125    Those who litigate in the public interest need to be dedicated to their cause and enthusiastic in its pursuit But dedication and enthusiasm are not enough public interest claims also require strict professionalism with rigorous attention to any legal problems inherent in the proposed claim    PCR is funded by donors The evidence of Ms Higgins is that donors are unwilling to contribute funds which might be recovered in costs by the respondents It is clear that the volunteer managers of PCR are proceeding with the knowledge that PCR will not have funds to pay any adverse order for costs made against them Further PCR received two sets of legal advice which did not rate its chances of success highly One advice explicitly stated there was no reasonable prospect of success on this application As a result of these two factors the respondents are exposed to a significant financial risk For PCR to proceed in these circumstances is to demonstrate a lack of consideration for the detriment which may be suffered by the respondents The fact that an organisation is a notforprofit organisation does not give it free rein to bring proceedings no matter how tenuous the basis on which they are brought without any regard to the detriment which those proceedings may cause to the respondents There is a duty upon an applicant to be responsible in their conduct of litigation and to ensure that proceedings are not brought without regard to the prospects of success This duty must be strictly observed by an impecunious applicant who may bring proceedings in which irrecoverable costs may be incurred If PCR wishes to bring the proceedings despite advice that it does not have particularly strong grounds it is entitled to do so However it cannot expect that the respondents bear the risk of its choice by incurring costs which PCR knows cannot be recovered As noted by Branson J in The Airtourer Cooperative Ltd v Millicer Aircraft Industries Pty Ltd 2004 FCA 1400 at 33     the amount of security should be sufficient to ensure that the directors of the applicant appreciate that the risk that the applicant might be ordered to pay the respondents costs has more than notional significance    There is a second factor which I consider to be significant in the circumstances of this case This is not a matter in which the applicant is the only impecunious party GCB is also a notforprofit organisation and there is evidence to suggest that GCB may be unable to afford to defend these proceedings GCBs net operating profit for the last financial year was 696874 and its balance sheet shows that it has a total equity of 2739910 To date it has expended in excess of 42000 in this litigation and its estimates suggest it will spend another 50000 PCR says this is an unfortunate consequence of litigation which is not properly a consideration in ordering security for costs I disagree I consider that it is a relevant discretionary consideration that proceedings even if successfully defended may bankrupt a respondent especially in circumstances where there are grounds for doubting the merits of the application GCB has submitted that it would be of comfort in determining their future course to know that costs could be recovered if their defence was successful I accept that this is a valid consideration  CONCLUSION   Weighing all of the above factors I consider that further security should be provided to GCB but that no order should be made in favour of ACMA Bearing in mind my preliminary conclusions on the merits of this application the fact that GCB is itself a notforprofit organisation and the quantum of costs which are likely to be incurred I consider that GCB should be provided with further security in the sum of 30000 In determining this amount I am aware that there is a possibility that an order for security will force the applicant to withdraw from this litigation However this is only one factor to be taken into consideration There are many other factors weighing in favour of an order as outlined above In the circumstances I consider that the interests of justice require that GCB be given some further assurance of its costs if the application is unsuccessful although I have awarded a lesser amount than that sought by GCB in order to reduce the risk that the litigation will be stifled Because of the delay because ACMA is not a notforprofit organisation and because an additional award of security would further increase the likelihood that the litigation may be stifled I decline to grant security for costs to ACMA I propose to stage the payment of security in order to minimise the burden upon PCR so that security is paid in three equal monthly instalments before the commencement of the hearing  I certify that the preceding thirtysix 36 numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice

Philip Morris Australia Ltd 2000 FCA 1004 at 125    Those who litigate in the public interest need to be dedicated to their cause and enthusiastic in its pursuit But dedication and enthusiasm are not enough public interest claims also require strict professionalism with rigorous attention to any legal problems inherent in the proposed claim    PCR is funded by donors The evidence of Ms Higgins is that donors are unwilling to contribute funds which might be recovered in costs by the respondents It is clear that the volunteer managers of PCR are proceeding with the knowledge that PCR will not have funds to pay any adverse order for costs made against them Further PCR received two sets of legal advice which did not rate its chances of success highly One advice explicitly stated there was no reasonable prospect of success on this application As a result of these two factors the respondents are exposed to a significant financial risk For PCR to proceed in these circumstances is to demonstrate a lack of consideration for the detriment which may be suffered by the respondents The fact that an organisation is a notforprofit organisation does not give it free rein to bring proceedings no matter how tenuous the basis on which they are brought without any regard to the detriment which those proceedings may cause to the respondents There is a duty upon an applicant to be responsible in their conduct of litigation and to ensure that proceedings are not brought without regard to the prospects of success This duty must be strictly observed by an impecunious applicant who may bring proceedings in which irrecoverable costs may be incurred If PCR wishes to bring the proceedings despite advice that it does not have particularly strong grounds it is entitled to do so However it cannot expect that the respondents bear the risk of its choice by incurring costs which PCR knows cannot be recovered As noted by Branson J in The Airtourer Cooperative Ltd v Millicer Aircraft Industries Pty Ltd 2004 FCA 1400 at 33     the amount of security should be sufficient to ensure that the directors of the applicant appreciate that the risk that the applicant might be ordered to pay the respondents costs has more than notional significance    There is a second factor which I consider to be significant in the circumstances of this case This is not a matter in which the applicant is the only impecunious party GCB is also a notforprofit organisation and there is evidence to suggest that GCB may be unable to afford to defend these proceedings GCBs net operating profit for the last financial year was 696874 and its balance sheet shows that it has a total equity of 2739910 To date it has expended in excess of 42000 in this litigation and its estimates suggest it will spend another 50000 PCR says this is an unfortunate consequence of litigation which is not properly a consideration in ordering security for costs I disagree I consider that it is a relevant discretionary consideration that proceedings even if successfully defended may bankrupt a respondent especially in circumstances where there are grounds for doubting the merits of the application GCB has submitted that it would be of comfort in determining their future course to know that costs could be recovered if their defence was successful I accept that this is a valid consideration  CONCLUSION   Weighing all of the above factors I consider that further security should be provided to GCB but that no order should be made in favour of ACMA Bearing in mind my preliminary conclusions on the merits of this application the fact that GCB is itself a notforprofit organisation and the quantum of costs which are likely to be incurred I consider that GCB should be provided with further security in the sum of 30000 In determining this amount I am aware that there is a possibility that an order for security will force the applicant to withdraw from this litigation However this is only one factor to be taken into consideration There are many other factors weighing in favour of an order as outlined above In the circumstances I consider that the interests of justice require that GCB be given some further assurance of its costs if the application is unsuccessful although I have awarded a lesser amount than that sought by GCB in order to reduce the risk that the litigation will be stifled Because of the delay because ACMA is not a notforprofit organisation and because an additional award of security would further increase the likelihood that the litigation may be stifled I decline to grant security for costs to ACMA I propose to stage the payment of security in order to minimise the burden upon PCR so that security is paid in three equal monthly instalments before the commencement of the hearing  I certify that the preceding thirtysix 36 numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Cowdroy  AssociateDated 11

06_1043.xml,c4,referred_to,The Airtourer Co-operative Ltd v Millicer Aircraft Industries Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 1400,On 26 May 2006 the Court delivered judgment in respect of a security for costs application made by the second respondent GCB see WyongGosford Progressive Community Radio Inc v Australian Communications and Media Authority 2006 FCA 625 the May decision Pursuant to that judgment the Court ordered that the applicant PCR pay security for the GCBs costs in the amount of 10000 The first respondent ACMA made no application for security for costs at this time At the time of the May decision the application before this Court was an application for leave to extend the time in which to file an application under the Administrative Decisions Judicial Review Act 1977 Cth ADJR Act However on 1 August 2006 the Court at the request of PCR granted leave to file an amended application in these proceedings The amended application included not only an application under the ADJR Act but also an application under s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 Cth  Judiciary Act  alleging the same errors of law as are contained in the draft ADJR Act application There is no time limit for the filing of an appeal under s 39B of the Judiciary Act  and so no leave was required to bring those proceedings Accordingly even if leave were not granted to file the ADJR Act application out of time PCR would have been entitled to proceed to hearing on the Judiciary Act application For this reason the Court decided to vacate the dates set down for hearing the leave application and to reserve the question of leave arising under the ADJR Act to be determined simultaneously with the hearing of the amended application As a result of the orders of 1 August 2006 the future course of the proceedings has been substantially altered and both respondents now face a final hearing on the amended application Immediately after the orders of 1 August 2006 were made ACMA indicated that it would seek security for costs Additionally GCB indicated it wished to seek further security pursuant to leave granted in the orders arising from the May decision At that time PCR indicated it could unconditionally offer an additional 10000 security to the second respondent which has now also been paid The first respondent now seeks security in the sum of 36148 The second respondent seeks further security in the sum of approximately 60000 I consider that the cost estimates provided by the first and second respondents are realistic  FACTS   The relevant background is contained in the May decision The applications in the present case are made under s 56 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 Cth The power to order security for costs under s 1335 of the Corporations Act 2001 Cth has no application in the present case because PCR is an incorporated association and not a company The considerations to be taken into account on a security for costs application are set out in the May decision at 11 and I will proceed to consider the relevant considerations below  THE RISK THAT A COSTS ORDER COULD NOT BE SATISFIED   It has now been conceded by PCR that it is impecunious and I accept that is extremely unlikely that PCR would be able to meet a costs order made against it in these proceedings The affidavit of Sylvia Higgins President and Ethnic Liaison Officer of PCR establishes that her attempts to solicit donations for the purpose of security for costs have been completely unsuccessful Donors to PCR have indicated they have no desire to contribute funds which might assist ACMA or GCB The money which has already been paid by way of security has been supplied wholly from the personal assets of Ms Higgins and her evidence was that she could not afford to provide any further assistance to PCR  THE MERITS OF APPLICATION   Since the May decision further information has been provided which casts light upon the merits of the application The affidavit of Ms Higgins attaches two advices received from counsel in relation to the prospects of success of the application The first of these advices sets out at length the law relating to the administrative appeals and states that the criticisms made of ACMAs decision  do not point to any error capable of leading to relief being granted upon judicial review  The advice concludes   As presently instructed I do not think that there is any basis upon which a successful judicial review application could be mounted    PCR subsequently sought advice from another counsel The advice from the second counsel is brief Its final two paragraphs state   In our view the grounds upon which to have the decision set aside are not particularly strong In relation to a number of the errors a court may ultimately hold that these reasonably fall within the proper exercise of the discretion vested in the ABA ACMA and do not constitute errors of law   Notwithstanding these concerns there are nevertheless reasonable prospects of showing that the ABA fell into reviewable error and having the decision set aside It appears to me that the conclusion in the final paragraph is not entirely consistent with the advice in the preceding paragraph  Ms Higgins gave evidence that she considered the second advice to have been better as it considered all of the particular facts of the case Irrespective it appears that on the basis of the advice given to PCR the prospects of success of this application are at best weak Nonetheless these proceedings were commenced on the basis of the second advice Counsel for PCR made reference to a third advice which apparently preceded both of the advices set out above and suggested it was optimistic However the Court has no evidence of such advice Counsel for PCR indicated that the strongest point to be raised in PCRs claim was the fact that of 2080 letters which had been submitted to ACMA in support of GCBs application for the broadcasting licence only 300 to 400 were relevant to ACMAs decision and therefore only those letters should have been relied upon by ACMA The greater portion of the letters had been prepared before the incorporation of GCB and PCR submits should have been given no weight by ACMA Instead PCR submits ACMA relied upon all of the letters and on a plain reading of ACMAs decision they were a critical factor in its decision to award the licence to GCB The letters which predated GCBs incorporation were written in support of an associated entity namely a Christian broadcasting station operating in Newcastle It was the Newcastle entity which was the original applicant for the licence under dispute until an application by GCB was substituted PCR submits that ACMA found that the programmes offered by the Newcastle entity and GCB were different However GCB relies upon the statement by Wilcox J at 47 in the previous judicial review application relating to this licence see WyongGosford Progressive Community Radio Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority and Anor 2003 FCA 33  2003 125 FCR 560 In that paragraph Wilcox J states   The letter of the ABA ACMA dated 23 December 2002 indicates the ABA did take into account material originally filed by Newcastle The letter specifically refers to letters of support and these were all originally provided by Newcastle However I do not think this made the material irrelevant The letters of support mainly addressed the matter of program content they were supportive of Christian programs That was a theme common to the applications of both Newcastle and Gosford It was open to Gosford to adopt this material as support for its own application It was for the ABA to determine the extent if any to which it should be discounted because of its provenance   Since this is an interlocutory application I have not yet had an opportunity to fully consider the evidence However prima facie the above passage from Wilcox J answers the claim now being raised by PCR PCR has also raised an allegation of fraud in its amended application stating that the date upon many of the letters of support were deliberately removed when the letters were submitted to ACMA in order to conceal the fact that the letters were written at a time when GCB had not yet been incorporated GCB however says that although the date was missing from some letters there were over 800 other letters which predated GCBs incorporation from which the date was not removed I agree that this fact appears to be inconsistent with the allegations of fraud made by PCR Prima facie if this is the sole foundation upon which PCRs fraud claim rests it would seem to be made on a tenuous basis particularly since it is not clear that it was an error for ACMA to take the older letters into consideration in any event Given the above circumstances the Court considers that as presently formulated PCRs claim has little chance of success This can only be a preliminary opinion given that I am yet to see and consider the entirety of the evidence but nonetheless it is relevant to the consideration of the security for costs application  WHETHER THE LITIGATION WILL BE STIFLED BY AN ORDER   PCR has submitted and I accept that there is a risk that the litigation may be stifled if an order for security for costs is made and certainly if an order is made in any significant amount This is one factor which must weigh into the consideration whether the Court should order security  WHETHER THERE ARE THIRD PARTIES STANDING BEHIND PCR   PCR is a notforprofit association which is staffed by volunteers There are no shareholders or creditors who have a pecuniary interest in the outcome of this litigation Rather this litigation is being brought in the interests of a sector of the community whose needs were met by the radio broadcasts of PCR In Friends of Hinchinbrook Society Inc v Minister for Environment and Ors No 1 1996 69 FCR 1 Branson J stated at 21   The applicant is an incorporated association of persons concerned with the environment In one sense every association is a front for its members they stand behind it and may be assumed themselves to support the objectives of the association and generally speaking the associations actions in intended advancement of those objectives There is however in my view a very real difference between the relationship of a member of a nonprofit association formed to advance a public interest to the association of which he or she is a member and the relationship of a shareholder to the company in which he or she holds shares The benefit which a shareholder might expect to obtain from litigation conducted by a company will ordinarily be whether directly or indirectly financial Members of a nonprofit association will not ordinarily benefit financially from litigation initiated by the association The benefit which they might obtain from such litigation is likely to be constituted by intellectual or emotional satisfaction    I accept that the volunteer managers of PCR in these proceedings cannot be equated with shareholders  standing behind  a company In this sense I consider the case is distinguishable from Bell Wholesale Co Ltd v Gates Export Corporation 1984 2 FCR 1 at 4 However this does not absolve the volunteer managers from their duty to act responsibly in the conduct of litigation see the further discussion at 2831  below  DELAY   PCR submits that the application by ACMA has been made too late and that accordingly it should not be entitled to an order for security In Crypta Fuels Pty Ltd and Anor v Svelte Corporation Pty Ltd and Ors 1995 19 ACSR 68 at 71 Lehane J having been referred to numerous authorities noted that   Without referring in any greater detail to those authorities my conclusion from a consideration of them is that there is first and foremost a proposition accepted in every one of the cases which is that if an application for security for costs is to be made it must be made promptly   The application for security by ACMA was first raised when leave was granted to rely upon the amended application on 1 August 2006 ACMA has suggested that because of the change in the future course of the proceedings engendered by the filing of the amended application it was entitled to change its position on security for costs It says that when the proceedings were commenced ACMA faced only a leave application whereas now it faces a full hearing However there was always a possibility that leave would be granted to the ADJR Act application in which case ACMA would also have faced a full hearing I do not consider that if the leave application had been heard and allowed ACMA would then have been entitled to ask for security for costs at least not unless that application had been specifically foreshadowed at an early stage of proceedings By the time the leave application had been finalised PCR would have spent a substantial sum in legal costs A security for costs application at that point may have stifled the litigation and made all of the costs incurred up until that time redundant ACMA further submits that it is required to behave as a model litigant which requires among other things that it not take advantage of a claimant who lacks the resources to litigate a legitimate claim To the extent that ACMA relies upon the model litigant principles I do not consider that these principles would have precluded an application for security being brought at an earlier stage of the proceedings Those principles in my opinion aim to prevent ACMA bringing a security for costs application which is oppressive However an application brought on legitimate grounds earlier in these proceedings would not have been oppressive At the very least and particularly in circumstances where GCB brought an application for security it was incumbent upon ACMA to indicate at an early stage that it would apply for security if leave were granted ACMA has relied upon Gartner v Ernst  Young No 3 2003 FCA 1437 at 34  in which case an application made 10 months after the institution of proceedings was held not to be too late At 34 Mansfield J stated that   The proceedings were instituted in August 2002 The proceedings were complex There have been a number of versions of the statement of claim The bank is in terms of the substantive allegations made in the proceedings but a small player It foreshadowed bringing an application for security for costs at an early point It made such an application in May 2003 At that time the proceedings had not much progressed They were delayed by the accountants challenge to the entitlement of the corporate applicants to have instituted the proceedings in the circumstances and then the appeal of the accountants against that decision In practical terms the application has been unable to much progress until resolution of those issues I do not therefore consider that the bank has engaged in delay in instituting the present application or in maintaining it There is also nothing to persuade me that the elapse of time before this application has in any way caused unfairness to the applicants There is no evidence to suggest that     I consider that the present case can be distinguished from Gartner in two respects Firstly the application for security for costs was not foreshadowed at any early time despite the fact that GCB was bringing an application for security Secondly PCR has clearly already incurred considerable expense in the preparation of these proceedings An order for security to the extent that it may stifle the proceedings would result in the waste of this expenditure If the application had been brought or at least foreshadowed at an earlier stage PCR may have reconsidered its position and this expenditure may not have been incurred Accordingly I consider PCR would be prejudiced by an order at this stage of proceedings  OTHER MATTERS RELEVANT TO THE DISCRETION   There are several further matters which I consider to be relevant to the discretion to be exercised in this case There is a duty upon an impecunious applicant to act responsibly in pursuing litigation As Wilcox J said in Tobacco Control Coalition Inc v Philip Morris Australia Ltd 2000 FCA 1004 at 125    Those who litigate in the public interest need to be dedicated to their cause and enthusiastic in its pursuit But

is entitled to do so However it cannot expect that the respondents bear the risk of its choice by incurring costs which PCR knows cannot be recovered As noted by Branson J in The Airtourer Cooperative Ltd v Millicer Aircraft Industries Pty Ltd 2004 FCA 1400 at 33     the amount of security should be sufficient to ensure that the directors of the applicant appreciate that the risk that the applicant might be ordered to pay the respondents costs has more than notional significance    There is a second factor which I consider to be significant in the circumstances of this case This is not a matter in which the applicant is the only impecunious party GCB is also a notforprofit organisation and there is evidence to suggest that GCB may be unable to afford to defend these proceedings GCBs net operating profit for the last financial year was 696874 and its balance sheet shows that it has a total equity of 2739910 To date it has expended in excess of 42000 in this litigation and its

faces a full hearing However there was always a possibility that leave would be granted to the ADJR Act application in which case ACMA would also have faced a full hearing I do not consider that if the leave application had been heard and allowed ACMA would then have been entitled to ask for security for costs at least not unless that application had been specifically foreshadowed at an early stage of proceedings By the time the leave application had been finalised PCR would have spent a substantial sum in legal costs A security for costs application at that point may have stifled the litigation and made all of the costs incurred up until that time redundant ACMA further submits that it is required to behave as a model litigant which requires among other things that it not take advantage of a claimant who lacks the resources to litigate a legitimate claim To the extent that ACMA relies upon the model litigant principles I do not consider that these principles would have precluded an application for security being brought at an earlier stage of the proceedings Those principles in my opinion aim to prevent ACMA bringing a security for costs application which is oppressive However an application brought on legitimate grounds earlier in these proceedings would not have been oppressive At the very least and particularly in circumstances where GCB brought an application for security it was incumbent upon ACMA to indicate at an early stage that it would apply for security if leave were granted ACMA has relied upon Gartner v Ernst  Young No 3 2003 FCA 1437 at 34  in which case an application made 10 months after the institution of proceedings was held not to be too late At 34 Mansfield J stated that   The proceedings were instituted in August 2002 The proceedings were complex There have been a number of versions of the statement of claim The bank is in terms of the substantive allegations made in the proceedings but a small player It foreshadowed bringing an application for security for costs at an early point It made such an application in May 2003 At that time the proceedings had not much progressed They were delayed by the accountants challenge to the entitlement of the corporate applicants to have instituted the proceedings in the circumstances and then the appeal of the accountants against that decision In practical terms the application has been unable to much progress until resolution of those issues I do not therefore consider that the bank has engaged in delay in instituting the present application or in maintaining it There is also nothing to persuade me that the elapse of time before this application has in any way caused unfairness to the applicants There is no evidence to suggest that     I consider that the present case can be distinguished from Gartner in two respects Firstly the application for security for costs was not foreshadowed at any early time despite the fact that GCB was bringing an application for security Secondly PCR has clearly already incurred considerable expense in the preparation of these proceedings An order for security to the extent that it may stifle the proceedings would result in the waste of this expenditure If the application had been brought or at least foreshadowed at an earlier stage PCR may have reconsidered its position and this expenditure may not have been incurred Accordingly I consider PCR would be prejudiced by an order at this stage of proceedings  OTHER MATTERS RELEVANT TO THE DISCRETION   There are several further matters which I consider to be relevant to the discretion to be exercised in this case There is a duty upon an impecunious applicant to act responsibly in pursuing litigation As Wilcox J said in Tobacco Control Coalition Inc v Philip Morris Australia Ltd 2000 FCA 1004 at 125    Those who litigate in the public interest need to be dedicated to their cause and enthusiastic in its pursuit But dedication and enthusiasm are not enough public interest claims also require strict professionalism with rigorous attention to any legal problems inherent in the proposed claim    PCR is funded by donors The evidence of Ms Higgins is that donors are unwilling to contribute funds which might be recovered in costs by the respondents It is clear that the volunteer managers of PCR are proceeding with the knowledge that PCR will not have funds to pay any adverse order for costs made against them Further PCR received two sets of legal advice which did not rate its chances of success highly One advice explicitly stated there was no reasonable prospect of success on this application As a result of these two factors the respondents are exposed to a significant financial risk For PCR to proceed in these circumstances is to demonstrate a lack of consideration for the detriment which may be suffered by the respondents The fact that an organisation is a notforprofit organisation does not give it free rein to bring proceedings no matter how tenuous the basis on which they are brought without any regard to the detriment which those proceedings may cause to the respondents There is a duty upon an applicant to be responsible in their conduct of litigation and to ensure that proceedings are not brought without regard to the prospects of success This duty must be strictly observed by an impecunious applicant who may bring proceedings in which irrecoverable costs may be incurred If PCR wishes to bring the proceedings despite advice that it does not have particularly strong grounds it is entitled to do so However it cannot expect that the respondents bear the risk of its choice by incurring costs which PCR knows cannot be recovered As noted by Branson J in The Airtourer Cooperative Ltd v Millicer Aircraft Industries Pty Ltd 2004 FCA 1400 at 33     the amount of security should be sufficient to ensure that the directors of the applicant appreciate that the risk that the applicant might be ordered to pay the respondents costs has more than notional significance    There is a second factor which I consider to be significant in the circumstances of this case This is not a matter in which the applicant is the only impecunious party GCB is also a notforprofit organisation and there is evidence to suggest that GCB may be unable to afford to defend these proceedings GCBs net operating profit for the last financial year was 696874 and its balance sheet shows that it has a total equity of 2739910 To date it has expended in excess of 42000 in this litigation and its estimates suggest it will spend another 50000 PCR says this is an unfortunate consequence of litigation which is not properly a consideration in ordering security for costs I disagree I consider that it is a relevant discretionary consideration that proceedings even if successfully defended may bankrupt a respondent especially in circumstances where there are grounds for doubting the merits of the application GCB has submitted that it would be of comfort in determining their future course to know that costs could be recovered if their defence was successful I accept that this is a valid consideration  CONCLUSION   Weighing all of the above factors I consider that further security should be provided to GCB but that no order should be made in favour of ACMA Bearing in mind my preliminary conclusions on the merits of this application the fact that GCB is itself a notforprofit organisation and the quantum of costs which are likely to be incurred I consider that GCB should be provided with further security in the sum of 30000 In determining this amount I am aware that there is a possibility that an order for security will force the applicant to withdraw from this litigation However this is only one factor to be taken into consideration There are many other factors weighing in favour of an order as outlined above In the circumstances I consider that the interests of justice require that GCB be given some further assurance of its costs if the application is unsuccessful although I have awarded a lesser amount than that sought by GCB in order to reduce the risk that the litigation will be stifled Because of the delay because ACMA is not a notforprofit organisation and because an additional award of security would further increase the likelihood that the litigation may be stifled I decline to grant security for costs to ACMA I propose to stage the payment of security in order to minimise the burden upon PCR so that security is paid in three equal monthly instalments before the commencement of the hearing  I certify that the preceding thirtysix 36 numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Cowdroy  AssociateDated 11

06_1043.xml,c6,referred_to,Wyong-Gosford Progressive Community Radio Inc v Australian Communications and Media Authority [2006] FCA 625,On 26 May 2006 the Court delivered judgment in respect of a security for costs application made by the second respondent GCB see WyongGosford Progressive Community Radio Inc v Australian Communications and Media Authority 2006 FCA 625 the May decision Pursuant to that judgment the Court ordered that the applicant PCR pay security for the GCBs costs in the amount of 10000 The first respondent ACMA made no application for security for costs at this time At the time of the May decision the application before this Court was an application for leave to extend the time in which to file an application under the Administrative Decisions Judicial Review Act 1977 Cth ADJR Act However on 1 August 2006 the Court at the request of PCR granted leave to file an amended application in these proceedings The amended application included not only an application under the ADJR Act but also an application under s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 Cth  Judiciary Act  alleging the same errors of law as are contained in the draft ADJR Act application There is no time limit for the filing of an appeal under s 39B of the Judiciary Act  and so no leave was required to bring those proceedings Accordingly even if leave were not granted to file the ADJR Act application out of time PCR would have been entitled to proceed to hearing on the Judiciary Act application For this reason the Court decided to vacate the dates set down for hearing the leave application and to reserve the question of leave arising under the ADJR Act to be determined simultaneously with the hearing of the amended application As a result of the orders of 1 August 2006 the future course of the proceedings has been substantially altered and both respondents now face a final hearing on the amended application Immediately after the orders of 1 August 2006 were made ACMA indicated that it would seek security for costs Additionally GCB indicated it wished to seek further security pursuant to leave granted in the orders arising from the May decision At that time PCR indicated it could unconditionally offer an additional 10000 security to the second respondent which has now also been paid The first respondent now seeks security in the sum of 36148 The second respondent seeks further security in the sum of approximately 60000 I consider that the cost estimates provided by the first and second respondents are realistic  FACTS   The relevant background is contained in the May decision The applications in the present case are made under s 56 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 Cth The power to order security for costs under s 1335 of the Corporations Act 2001 Cth has no application in the present case because PCR is an incorporated association and not a company The considerations to be taken into account on a security for costs application are set out in the May decision at 11 and I will proceed to consider the relevant considerations below  THE RISK THAT A COSTS ORDER COULD NOT BE SATISFIED   It has now been conceded by PCR that it is impecunious and I accept that is extremely unlikely that PCR would be able to meet a costs order made against it in these proceedings The affidavit of Sylvia Higgins President and Ethnic Liaison Officer of PCR establishes that her attempts to solicit donations for the purpose of security for costs have been completely unsuccessful Donors to PCR have indicated they have no desire to contribute funds which might assist ACMA or GCB The money which has already been paid by way of security has been supplied wholly from the personal assets of Ms Higgins and her evidence was that she could not afford to provide any further assistance to PCR  THE MERITS OF APPLICATION   Since the May decision further information has been provided which casts light upon the merits of the application The affidavit of Ms Higgins attaches two advices received from counsel in relation to the prospects of success of the application The first of these advices sets out at length the law relating to the administrative appeals and states that the criticisms made of ACMAs decision  do not point to any error capable of leading to relief being granted upon judicial review  The advice concludes   As presently instructed I do not think that there is any basis upon which a successful judicial review application could be mounted    PCR subsequently sought advice from another counsel The advice from the second counsel is brief Its final two paragraphs state   In our view the grounds upon which to have the decision set aside are not particularly strong In relation to a number of the errors a court may ultimately hold that these reasonably fall within the proper exercise of the discretion vested in the ABA ACMA and do not constitute errors of law   Notwithstanding these concerns there are nevertheless reasonable prospects of showing that the ABA fell into reviewable error and having the decision set aside It appears to me that the conclusion in the final paragraph is not entirely consistent with the advice in the preceding paragraph  Ms Higgins gave evidence that she considered the second advice to have been better as it considered all of the particular facts of the case Irrespective it appears that on the basis of the advice given to PCR the prospects of success of this application are at best weak Nonetheless these proceedings were commenced on the basis of the second advice Counsel for PCR made reference to a third advice which apparently preceded both of the advices set out above and suggested it was optimistic However the Court has no evidence of such advice Counsel for PCR indicated that the strongest point to be raised in PCRs claim was the fact that of 2080 letters which had been submitted to ACMA in support of GCBs application for the broadcasting licence only 300 to 400 were relevant to ACMAs decision and therefore only those letters should have been relied upon by ACMA The greater portion of the letters had been prepared before the incorporation of GCB and PCR submits should have been given no weight by ACMA Instead PCR submits ACMA relied upon all of the letters and on a plain reading of ACMAs decision they were a critical factor in its decision to award the licence to GCB The letters which predated GCBs incorporation were written in support of an associated entity namely a Christian broadcasting station operating in Newcastle It was the Newcastle entity which was the original applicant for the licence under dispute until an application by GCB was substituted PCR submits that ACMA found that the programmes offered by the Newcastle entity and GCB were different However GCB relies upon the statement by Wilcox J at 47 in the previous judicial review application relating to this licence see WyongGosford Progressive Community Radio Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority and Anor 2003 FCA 33  2003 125 FCR 560 In that paragraph Wilcox J states   The letter of the ABA ACMA dated 23 December 2002 indicates the ABA did take into account material originally filed by Newcastle The letter specifically refers to letters of support and these were all originally provided by Newcastle However I do not think this made the material irrelevant The letters of support mainly addressed the matter of program content they were supportive of Christian programs That was a theme common to the applications of both Newcastle and Gosford It was open to Gosford to adopt this material as support for its own application It was for the ABA to determine the extent if any to which it should be discounted because of its provenance   Since this is an interlocutory application I have not yet had an opportunity to fully consider the evidence However prima facie the above passage from Wilcox J answers the claim now being raised by PCR PCR has also raised an allegation of fraud in its amended application stating that the date upon many of the letters of support were deliberately removed when the letters were submitted to ACMA in order to conceal the fact that the letters were written at a time when GCB had not yet been incorporated GCB however says that although the date was missing from some letters there were over 800 other letters which predated GCBs incorporation from which the date was not removed I agree that this fact appears to be inconsistent with the allegations of fraud made by PCR Prima facie if this is the sole foundation upon which PCRs fraud claim rests it would seem to be made on a tenuous basis particularly since it is not clear that it was an error for ACMA to take the older letters into consideration in any event Given the above circumstances the Court considers that as presently formulated PCRs claim has little chance of success This can only be a preliminary opinion given that I am yet to see and consider the entirety of the evidence but nonetheless it is relevant to the consideration of the security for costs application  WHETHER THE LITIGATION WILL BE STIFLED BY AN ORDER   PCR has submitted and I accept that there is a risk that the litigation may be stifled if an order for security for costs is made and certainly if an order is made in any significant amount This is one factor which must weigh into the consideration whether the Court should order security  WHETHER THERE ARE THIRD PARTIES STANDING BEHIND PCR   PCR is a notforprofit association which is staffed by volunteers There are no shareholders or creditors who have a pecuniary interest in the outcome of this litigation Rather this litigation is being brought in the interests of a sector of the community whose needs were met by the radio broadcasts of PCR In Friends of Hinchinbrook Society Inc v Minister for Environment and Ors No 1 1996 69 FCR 1 Branson J stated at 21   The applicant is an incorporated association of persons concerned with the environment In one sense every association is a front for its members they stand behind it and may be assumed themselves to support the objectives of the association and generally speaking the associations actions in intended advancement of those objectives There is however in my view a very real difference between the relationship of a member of a nonprofit association formed to advance a public interest to the association of which he or she is a member and the relationship of a shareholder to the company in which he or she holds shares The benefit which a shareholder might expect to obtain from litigation conducted by a company will ordinarily be whether directly or indirectly financial Members of a nonprofit association will not ordinarily benefit financially from litigation initiated by the association The benefit which they might obtain from such litigation is likely to be constituted by intellectual or emotional satisfaction    I accept that the volunteer managers of PCR in these proceedings cannot be equated with shareholders  standing behind  a company In this sense I consider the case is distinguishable from Bell Wholesale Co Ltd v Gates Export Corporation 1984 2 FCR 1 at 4 However this does not absolve the volunteer managers from their duty to act responsibly in the conduct of litigation see the further discussion at 2831  below  DELAY   PCR submits that the application by ACMA has been made too late and that accordingly it should not be entitled to an order for security In Crypta Fuels Pty Ltd and Anor v Svelte Corporation Pty Ltd and Ors 1995 19 ACSR 68 at 71 Lehane J having been referred to numerous authorities noted that   Without referring in any greater detail to those authorities my conclusion from a consideration of them is that there is first and foremost a proposition accepted in every one of the cases which is that if an application for security for costs is to be made it must be made promptly   The application for security by ACMA was first raised when leave was granted to rely upon the amended application on 1 August 2006 ACMA has suggested that because of the change in the future course of the proceedings engendered by the filing of the amended application it was entitled to change its position on security for costs It says that when the proceedings were commenced ACMA faced only a leave application whereas now it faces a full hearing However there was always a possibility that leave would be granted to the ADJR Act application in which case ACMA would also have faced a full hearing I do not consider that if the leave application had been heard and allowed ACMA would then have been entitled to ask for security for costs at least not unless that application had been specifically foreshadowed at an early stage of proceedings By the time the leave application had been finalised PCR would have spent a substantial sum in legal costs A security for costs application at that point may have stifled the litigation and made all of the costs incurred up until that time redundant ACMA further submits that it is required to behave as a model litigant which requires among other things that it not take advantage of a claimant who lacks the resources to litigate a legitimate claim To the extent that ACMA relies upon the model litigant principles I do not consider that these principles would have precluded an application for security being brought at an earlier stage of the proceedings Those principles in my opinion aim to prevent ACMA bringing a security for costs application which is oppressive However an application brought on legitimate grounds earlier in these proceedings would not have been oppressive At the very least and particularly in circumstances where GCB brought an application for security it was incumbent upon ACMA to indicate at an early stage that it would apply for security if leave were granted ACMA has relied upon Gartner v Ernst  Young No 3 2003 FCA 1437 at 34  in which case an application made 10 months after the institution of proceedings was held not to be too late At 34 Mansfield J stated that   The proceedings were instituted in August 2002 The proceedings were complex There have been a number of versions of the statement of claim The bank is in terms of the substantive allegations made in the proceedings but a small player It foreshadowed bringing an application for security for costs at an early point It made such an application in May 2003 At that time the proceedings had not much progressed They were delayed by the accountants challenge to the entitlement of the corporate applicants to have instituted the proceedings in the circumstances and then the appeal of the accountants against that decision In practical terms the application has been unable to much progress until resolution of those issues I do not therefore consider that the bank has engaged in delay in instituting the present application or in maintaining it There is also nothing to persuade me that the elapse of time before this application has in any way caused unfairness to the applicants There is no evidence to suggest that     I consider that the present case can be distinguished from Gartner in two respects Firstly the application for security for costs was not foreshadowed at any early time despite the fact that GCB was bringing an application for security Secondly PCR has clearly already incurred considerable expense in the preparation of these proceedings An order for security to the extent that it may stifle the proceedings would result in the waste of this expenditure If the application had been brought or at least foreshadowed at an earlier stage PCR may have reconsidered its position and this expenditure may not have been incurred Accordingly I consider PCR would be prejudiced by an order at this stage of proceedings  OTHER MATTERS RELEVANT TO THE DISCRETION   There are several further matters which I consider to be relevant to the discretion to be exercised in this case There is a duty upon an impecunious applicant to act responsibly in pursuing litigation As Wilcox J said in

might be ordered to pay the respondents costs has more than notional significance    There is a second factor which I consider to be significant in the circumstances of this case This is not a matter in which the applicant is the only impecunious party GCB is also a notforprofit organisation and there is evidence to suggest that GCB may be unable to afford to defend these proceedings GCBs net

into consideration in any event Given the above circumstances the Court considers that as presently formulated PCRs claim has little chance of success This can only be a preliminary opinion given that I am yet to see and consider the entirety of the evidence but nonetheless it is relevant to the consideration of the security for costs application  WHETHER THE LITIGATION WILL BE STIFLED BY AN ORDER   PCR has submitted and I accept that there is a risk that the litigation may be stifled if an order for security for costs is made and certainly if an order is made in any significant amount This is one factor which must weigh into the consideration whether the Court should order security  WHETHER THERE ARE THIRD PARTIES STANDING BEHIND PCR   PCR is a notforprofit association which is staffed by volunteers There are no shareholders or creditors who have a pecuniary interest in the outcome of this litigation Rather this litigation is being brought in the interests of a sector of the community whose needs were met by the radio broadcasts of PCR In Friends of Hinchinbrook Society Inc v Minister for Environment and Ors No 1 1996 69 FCR 1 Branson J stated at 21   The applicant is an incorporated association of persons concerned with the environment In one sense every association is a front for its members they stand behind it and may be assumed themselves to support the objectives of the association and generally speaking the associations actions in intended advancement of those objectives There is however in my view a very real difference between the relationship of a member of a nonprofit association formed to advance a public interest to the association of which he or she is a member and the relationship of a shareholder to the company in which he or she holds shares The benefit which a shareholder might expect to obtain from litigation conducted by a company will ordinarily be whether directly or indirectly financial Members of a nonprofit association will not ordinarily benefit financially from litigation initiated by the association The benefit which they might obtain from such litigation is likely to be constituted by intellectual or emotional satisfaction    I accept that the volunteer managers of PCR in these proceedings cannot be equated with shareholders  standing behind  a company In this sense I consider the case is distinguishable from Bell Wholesale Co Ltd v Gates Export Corporation 1984 2 FCR 1 at 4 However this does not absolve the volunteer managers from their duty to act responsibly in the conduct of litigation see the further discussion at 2831  below  DELAY   PCR submits that the application by ACMA has been made too late and that accordingly it should not be entitled to an order for security In Crypta Fuels Pty Ltd and Anor v Svelte Corporation Pty Ltd and Ors 1995 19 ACSR 68 at 71 Lehane J having been referred to numerous authorities noted that   Without referring in any greater detail to those authorities my conclusion from a consideration of them is that there is first and foremost a proposition accepted in every one of the cases which is that if an application for security for costs is to be made it must be made promptly   The application for security by ACMA was first raised when leave was granted to rely upon the amended application on 1 August 2006 ACMA has suggested that because of the change in the future course of the proceedings engendered by the filing of the amended application it was entitled to change its position on security for costs It says that when the proceedings were commenced ACMA faced only a leave application whereas now it faces a full hearing However there was always a possibility that leave would be granted to the ADJR Act application in which case ACMA would also have faced a full hearing I do not consider that if the leave application had been heard and allowed ACMA would then have been entitled to ask for security for costs at least not unless that application had been specifically foreshadowed at an early stage of proceedings By the time the leave application had been finalised PCR would have spent a substantial sum in legal costs A security for costs application at that point may have stifled the litigation and made all of the costs incurred up until that time redundant ACMA further submits that it is required to behave as a model litigant which requires among other things that it not take advantage of a claimant who lacks the resources to litigate a legitimate claim To the extent that ACMA relies upon the model litigant principles I do not consider that these principles would have precluded an application for security being brought at an earlier stage of the proceedings Those principles in my opinion aim to prevent ACMA bringing a security for costs application which is oppressive However an application brought on legitimate grounds earlier in these proceedings would not have been oppressive At the very least and particularly in circumstances where GCB brought an application for security it was incumbent upon ACMA to indicate at an early stage that it would apply for security if leave were granted ACMA has relied upon Gartner v Ernst  Young No 3 2003 FCA 1437 at 34  in which case an application made 10 months after the institution of proceedings was held not to be too late At 34 Mansfield J stated that   The proceedings were instituted in August 2002 The proceedings were complex There have been a number of versions of the statement of claim The bank is in terms of the substantive allegations made in the proceedings but a small player It foreshadowed bringing an application for security for costs at an early point It made such an application in May 2003 At that time the proceedings had not much progressed They were delayed by the accountants challenge to the entitlement of the corporate applicants to have instituted the proceedings in the circumstances and then the appeal of the accountants against that decision In practical terms the application has been unable to much progress until resolution of those issues I do not therefore consider that the bank has engaged in delay in instituting the present application or in maintaining it There is also nothing to persuade me that the elapse of time before this application has in any way caused unfairness to the applicants There is no evidence to suggest that     I consider that the present case can be distinguished from Gartner in two respects Firstly the application for security for costs was not foreshadowed at any early time despite the fact that GCB was bringing an application for security Secondly PCR has clearly already incurred considerable expense in the preparation of these proceedings An order for security to the extent that it may stifle the proceedings would result in the waste of this expenditure If the application had been brought or at least foreshadowed at an earlier stage PCR may have reconsidered its position and this expenditure may not have been incurred Accordingly I consider PCR would be prejudiced by an order at this stage of proceedings  OTHER MATTERS RELEVANT TO THE DISCRETION   There are several further matters which I consider to be relevant to the discretion to be exercised in this case There is a duty upon an impecunious applicant to act responsibly in pursuing litigation As Wilcox J said in Tobacco Control Coalition Inc v Philip Morris Australia Ltd 2000 FCA 1004 at 125    Those who litigate in the public interest need to be dedicated to their cause and enthusiastic in its pursuit But dedication and enthusiasm are not enough public interest claims also require strict professionalism with rigorous attention to any legal problems inherent in the proposed claim    PCR is funded by donors The evidence of Ms Higgins is that donors are unwilling to contribute funds which might be recovered in costs by the respondents It is clear that the volunteer managers of PCR are proceeding with the knowledge that PCR will not have funds to pay any adverse order for costs made against them Further PCR received two sets of legal advice which did not rate its chances of success highly One advice explicitly stated there was no reasonable prospect of success on this application As a result of these two factors the respondents are exposed to a significant financial risk For PCR to proceed in these circumstances is to demonstrate a lack of consideration for the detriment which may be suffered by the respondents The fact that an organisation is a notforprofit organisation does not give it free rein to bring proceedings no matter how tenuous the basis on which they are brought without any regard to the detriment which those proceedings may cause to the respondents There is a duty upon an applicant to be responsible in their conduct of litigation and to ensure that proceedings are not brought without regard to the prospects of success This duty must be strictly observed by an impecunious applicant who may bring proceedings in which irrecoverable costs may be incurred If PCR wishes to bring the proceedings despite advice that it does not have particularly strong grounds it is entitled to do so However it cannot expect that the respondents bear the risk of its choice by incurring costs which PCR knows cannot be recovered As noted by Branson J in The Airtourer Cooperative Ltd v Millicer Aircraft Industries Pty Ltd 2004 FCA 1400 at 33     the amount of security should be sufficient to ensure that the directors of the applicant appreciate that the risk that the applicant might be ordered to pay the respondents costs has more than notional significance    There is a second factor which I consider to be significant in the circumstances of this case This is not a matter in which the applicant is the only impecunious party GCB is also a notforprofit organisation and there is evidence to suggest that GCB may be unable to afford to defend these proceedings GCBs net operating profit for the last financial year was 696874 and its balance sheet shows that it has a total equity of 2739910 To date it has expended in excess of 42000 in this litigation and its estimates suggest it will spend another 50000 PCR says this is an unfortunate consequence of litigation which is not properly a consideration in ordering security for costs I disagree I consider that it is a relevant discretionary consideration that proceedings even if successfully defended may bankrupt a respondent especially in circumstances where there are grounds for doubting the merits of the application GCB has submitted that it would be of comfort in determining their future course to know that costs could be recovered if their defence was successful I accept that this is a valid consideration  CONCLUSION   Weighing all of the above factors I consider that further security should be provided to GCB but that no order should be made in favour of ACMA Bearing in mind my preliminary conclusions on the merits of this application the fact that GCB is itself a notforprofit organisation and the quantum of costs which are likely to be incurred I consider that GCB should be provided with further security in the sum of 30000 In determining this amount I am aware that there is a possibility that an order for security will force the applicant to withdraw from this litigation However this is only one factor to be taken into consideration There are many other factors weighing in favour of an order as outlined above In the circumstances I consider that the interests of justice require that GCB be given some further assurance of its costs if the application is unsuccessful although I have awarded a lesser amount than that sought by GCB in order to reduce the risk that the litigation will be stifled Because of the delay because ACMA is not a notforprofit organisation and because an additional award of security would further increase the likelihood that the litigation may be stifled I decline to grant security for costs to ACMA I propose to stage the payment of security in order to minimise the burden upon PCR so that security is paid in three equal monthly instalments before the commencement of the hearing  I certify that the preceding thirtysix 36 numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice

06_1045.xml,c11,quoted,Minister for Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs v SZFHC [2006] FCAFC 73,The respondent concedes that these cases reflect a factual point of distinction from the circumstances of this case but it is a distinction without a difference as a matter of principle In support of that notion the respondent says that although s 426A confers a discretion it is a discretion to be exercised recognising that Division 4 of the Act contains an exhaustive statement of the natural justice hearing rule that the course the Tribunal might take is unconstrained other than by reference to the language of the section and that Minister for Immigration  Multicultural  Indigenous Affairs v SZFHC 2006 FCAFC 73 at 38 39  MIMIA v SZFHC  is authority for the proposition that if the Tribunal complies with ss 425 and 425A in inviting an applicant to appear before the Tribunal the Tribunal is not required to make further enquiries if the applicant fails to attend Whilst in MIMIA v SZFHC  the appellant failed to respond to a hearing invitation issued by the Tribunal and in NAVX v MIMIA and NASF v MIMIA  the respective appellant elected not to attend before the Tribunal in response to an invitation these differences it is said do not give rise to any constraint upon the general principle identified by the respondentIt is common ground that the Tribunal complied with the requirements of the Act in inviting the appellant to appear before it and in issuing the notice The exhaustive statement of the natural justice hearing rule requires the Tribunal in the circumstances recited in ss 425 and 425A to provide the appellant with an opportunity to appear before the Tribunal to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review  The exercise of the power conferred by s 426A upon the Tribunal to make a decision on the review without taking any further action to allow or enable the applicant to appear before it is in terms predicated only upon the conjunction of a complying invitation having issued to the appellant pursuant to s 425 to appear before the Tribunal and a failure on the part of the appellant to appear on the day on which or at the time and place at which the appellant is scheduled to appear  The power to make a decision on the review consequent upon the conjunction of those events does not however prevent the Tribunal from taking a different course of rescheduling the applicants appearance before it or from delaying its decision on the review in order to enable the applicants appearance before it as rescheduled Although I accept that the power conferred upon the Tribunal cannot be exercised capriciously and must be exercised reasonably the election to make a decision on the review is not by itself the expression of an unreasonable exercise of the power It is expressly contemplated by the section If the evidence demonstrates in a particular case that the exercise of the power to make a decision on the review was capricious or wholly failed to take account of any matter put before it as to the reason for the failure on the part of the appellant to attend before the Tribunal a question of procedural fairness might arise This is not such a case There seems to me to be no obligation falling upon the Tribunal to make any inquiry as to the failure on the part of the appellant to appear In MIMIA v SZFHC  the applicant for a Protection Visa said that the Tribunal was on notice that he may not have received the invitation letter to attend before the Tribunal for the purposes of ss 425 and 425A because the Response to Hearing Invitation form was not returned to the Tribunal because the letter addressed to the applicants residential address was returned unclaimed and in those circumstances he did not appear at the hearing Applicant SZFHC contended that in those circumstances an obligation fell upon the Tribunal to find another method of contacting the respondent 38 Their Honours Spender French and Cowdroy JJ at 39 said  it is clear that ss 425 and 425A of the Migration Act are to be read together Accordingly the Tribunal having complied with one of the methods prescribed in s 425A in fact two was under no further obligation to search the papers lodged with it to discover if there might be some other avenue of communicating with the applicant

06_106.xml,c1,cited,Ryder v Morley (1986) 12 FCR 438,32 At trial in Ryder v Morley 1986 12 FCR 438 Toohey J held that the attachment of the detective sergeant to the NCA did not deprive him of his status as a constable within the meaning of the Crimes Act  and nor did it deprive him of the right to seek the issue of a search warrant pursuant to s 10 of that Act His Honour did not see anything to preclude recourse being had to s 10 of the Crimes Act  as he explained in the following passage at 441  It is clear that he was invoking s 10 and not relying upon any provision of the National Crime Authority Act 1984  Had a member of the Authority required a warrant for the purpose of a special function of the Authority it was open to that member to apply to a judge of a prescribed court under s 221 But the warrant was sought by a member of the Australian Federal Police who satisfied a justice of the peace by information on oath that a warrant was justified in terms of s 10 of the Crimes Act 1914   Toohey J also said that s 2210 was conclusive against the applicants argument   I agree with counsel for the respondents that the subsection simply means what it says and that there is no justification for reading it down Counsel for the applicants argued that if a police officer seconded to the Authority could rely upon s 2210 to justify the obtaining of a warrant under s 10 of the Crimes Act 1914  the limitations in s 22 could be set at naught But that is not so The limitations in s 22 apply when the Authority relies upon a special investigation which it is conducting to obtain a search warrant in the terms of that section But if a constable can satisfy a justice of the peace in terms of s 10 of the Crimes Act 1914  that a search warrant is justified the justice may issue a warrant under that section There is nothing uncertain or ambiguous about s 2210  in my view the subsection is designed for the sort of situation that arose in the present case  I consider that his Honours reasoning is compelling33 On appeal from Toohey J the Full Court said at 263264  It is submitted that bearing in mind relevant parts of s 22  and other provisions in the Act protective of individuals being investigated by the Authority see ss 2832 it cannot have been intended that the protection could be subverted by reliance on s 101 of the Crimes Act 1914  We have in what we have already said attempted to show the different purposes and functions of s 101 of the Crimes Act 1914 and s 22 of the Act In our view it is not to be assumed that the latter negatives the operation of the former Indeed the contrary is expressly provided for s 2210   We are of the view that the provisions of the Act referred to cannot properly be construed as involving any restriction on the use of s 101 of the Crimes Act 1914 for purposes such as those under discussion On the contrary once an offence is known or suspected s 101 acts as a convenient corollary to s 22 and other powers of the Authority34 In the present case the applicant attempted to distinguish Ryder v Morley on the ground that Toohey J and the Full Court did not know whether the search warrant was obtained in connection with an NCA special investigation In my view the supposed distinction is not made out It is founded on a statement in the Full Court judgment that we do not know whether it was a special investigation which deals with a matter relating to a specified relevant criminal activity and is not confined to things used or believed to be intended to be used for the commission of a crime It is not clear whether the Full Court was saying that it did not know whether it was a special investigation at all or whether it was saying that it did not know that the special investigation had the particular features it mentions However it does not matter The applicants whole argument in Ryder v Morley invited the Court to assume that a search warrant could have been issued pursuant to s 22 of the NCA Act  In other words the argument invited the Court to assume that the search warrant in question had been sought in connection with a special investigation by the NCA The Court was well aware that the power conferred by s 221 of the NCA Act could only be exercised in connection with a special investigation The thrust of the argument the Court was addressing was that as s 22 was available the legislative intention was that it should apply to the exclusion of s 10 of the Crimes Act  Both Toohey J and the Full Court addressed the merits of this argument on the assumption that s 22 was available and that its conditions could have been satisfied It follows that the observations made both by Toohey J and the Full Court concerning the relationship between s 22 of the NCA Act and s 10 of the Crimes Act were premised upon an assumption favourable to the applicant in that case that the warrant had been sought in order to advance a special investigation by the NCA and so could have been obtained under s 22 of the NCA Act

06_106.xml,c8,cited,Hart v Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police [2002] FCAFC 392 ; (2002) 124 FCR 384,49 In Hart v Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police 2002 FCAFC 392  2002 124 FCR 384  Hart  at 399403 the Full Court French Sackville and RD Nicholson JJ explained the approach that should be adopted to the construction of Pt 1AA The Court said  64 The construction of statutes authorising the search of premises and the seizure of things from them begins with the ordinary meaning of the words considered according to their context and the legislative purpose This reflects the primary object of all statutory construction which according to Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority 1998 HCA 28  1998 194 CLR 355 at 381 per McHugh Gummow Kirby and Hayne JJ is to construe the relevant provision so that it is consistent with the language and purpose of all the provisions of the statute The importance of purpose and policy was emphasised in that case by reference to the observation of Dixon CJ in Commissioner for Railways NSW v Agalianos 1955 HCA 27  1955 92 CLR 390 at 397 the context the general purpose and policy of a provision and its consistency and fairness are surer guides to its meaning than the logic with which it is constructed       65 The purpose of search and seizure provisions is to provide for the gathering of information to determine whether offences have been committed and to facilitate proof of them Rogers v Moore 1992 39 FCR 201 at 217 per French J Recognition of that purpose may yield a construction of the legislative words that is not necessarily narrowly defined Remaining ambiguity or doubt whether of meaning or application will in accordance with authority be resolved in favour of the rights and freedoms of the subject   66 There is a significant emphasis in the case law on the need to apply a strict construction to such provisions This is because as a general rule the search of premises and the seizure of goods therefrom has always been illegal unless authorised by law The manifestation of that authority has traditionally been in the form of a warrant         67 Where strict construction is invoked it is necessary to keep in mind what that term means In the context of penal statutes it was said a long time ago and yet consistently with contemporary doctrine  Scott v Cawsey 1907 HCA 80  1907 5 CLR 132 at 155 per Isaacs J to reflect nothing more than a requirement that    a Court should be specially careful in the view of the consequences on both sides to ascertain and enforce the actual commands of the legislature not weakening them in favour of private persons to the detriment of the public welfare nor enlarging them as against the individuals towards whom they are directed    The invocation of strict construction in penal statutes was described by Gibbs J as perhaps one of last resort Beckwith v The Queen 1976 HCA 55  1976 135 CLR 569 at 576 It should not distract from the primary object of statutory construction enunciated in Project Blue Sky The search and seizure provisions of the Crimes Act are not punitive They are not to be treated as penal provisions It is more appropriate to see them as subject to the general principles that govern statutory interference with established common law rights and freedoms Potter v Minahan 1908 HCA 63  1908 7 CLR 277 at 304 per OConnor J  Bropho v Western Australia 1990 HCA 24  1990 171 CLR 1 at 18 per Mason CJ Deane Dawson Toohey Gaudron and McHugh JJ Coco v The Queen 1994 HCA 15  1994 179 CLR 427 at 437438 per Mason CJ Brennan Gaudron and McHugh JJ   68 Notwithstanding these general considerations effect must be given to the importance attached by the legislature to the use of search warrants as an important and legitimate tool in the detection and prosecution of criminal offences Where the language of the statute authorising their use offers choices between one construction requiring fine legal judgments in the issue andor execution of warrants and another which is more likely to be consistent with operational realities then the latter construction is generally to be preferred The need to recognise the operational realities in which warrants are executed was acknowledged by the learned primary judge who referred in that connection to Dunesky v Commonwealth 1996 89 A Crim R 372 at 382383 per Lockhart J See also Baker v Campbell 1983 HCA 39  1983 153 CLR 52 at 83 per Mason J The tension between the public and private interests involved in the issue and execution of search warrants was referred to by Lockhart J in Crowley v Murphy 1981 52 FLR 123 at 141142 Northrop J agreeing at 13250 The Court concluded its discussion by observing that  there is no requirement that the Court approach that task armed with a prima facie hostility to the invasion of privacy that is necessarily involved in the exercise of investigative powers Privacy is but one of the interests to be taken into account in construing legislation authorising the exercise of such power51 The applicant submitted that the Full Courts reference in par 65 to the gathering of information to determine whether offences have been committed and to facilitate proof of them supports its argument I disagree When the relevant passages in the judgment of the Full Court are read as a whole it is plain that the Full Court was not suggesting that information can only be gathered under a search warrant if it serves the dual purpose of both determining whether offences have been committed and facilitating proof of them in a criminal prosecution process Moreover I do not consider that the Full Court was referring to proof in a criminal prosecution process as distinct from proof in the broader context of a criminal investigation that may or may not result in a prosecution

FCA 557  2000 100 FCR 323  Kovalev  at 326328 French J explained the relevant principles  In making a consent order the Court exercises judicial power This is a power conferred upon it by the Parliament under Ch III of the Constitution of the Commonwealth Its exercise is a public function and operates to bind the parties Its public character applies to agreed orders disposing of private litigation between citizens or corporations and proceedings brought by or against governments and their agencies or public authorities   An order disposing of proceedings by consent must be selfexplanatory as must any order It is not appropriate to make an order of uncertain content or the content of which is to be derived from materials which are not on the public record   There is a fundamental difficulty where a court makes an order remitting a matter to a decisionmaker or tribunal to be decided according to law and the court itself is not informed of the nature of the error conceded The court is then making an order without being apprised of its basis and proposed operation To do so in my opinion is a purported but not an actual exercise of judicial power Moreover in a practical sense the decisionmaker or tribunal lacks the benefit of any binding direction from the court as to precisely what it is that the decisionmaker or tribunal is required to do In the present case the precise concession which led to the proposed consent order had not been communicated by the respondent to the applicant The possibility arose that the matter could have been remitted to the Tribunal with the parties themselves not being ad idem as to the error of law which had led to the decision being set aside and which the Tribunal was required to rectify And even if there had been such an agreement the terms of the order proposed would not have disclosed to the public what the parties had agreed should be its content In the particular case where a tribunal decision is set aside the Tribunal itself is not usually a party and has played no role in the negotiation of the agreement that it erred in law A fortiori in that case the order must be clear and complete and the Court must be satisfied that it is appropriate       It is wellestablished that in making a consent order or indeed in accepting undertakings the Court must have regard to the limits of its power The parties cannot by consent confer power on the Court to make orders which the Court lacks power to make Thomson Australian Holdings Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission  1981  1981 HCA 48  148 CLR 150 at 163 The question whether a consent order is to be made is not concluded by a finding that it is formally within the power of the Court In the exercise of its power the Court is not merely giving effect to the wishes of the parties it is exercising a public function and must have regard to the public interest in doing so see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Real Estate Institute WA Inc 1999 161 ALR 79 at 86 and the authorities referred to there It is important therefore that the Court itself addresses and is satisfied of the basis upon which its order is to be made and in particular where the order sets aside the decision of an official decisionmaker or a tribunal       In the case of error of law attributed to a decisionmaker or tribunal there is a particular public interest which requires the Courts specification of the error and its satisfaction that error occurred   It is also a substantial discourtesy for a court to overturn the decision of an official decisionmaker and a fortiori that of a statutory tribunal without consideration of the error that leads to the decision being overturned or communication of the terms of that error to the decisionmaker or tribunal If such a determination is to be set aside on the basis that it has failed to apply or has misapplied the law whether substantive or procedural there may potentially be some precedential impact in other like cases To permit the principle underlying the order to be formulated only by the parties in their submissions to the decisionmaker or the Tribunal leaves the content of that principle in the hands of the parties As French J noted Sackville J had adopted a similar approach in Sanchez v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs 1999 FCA 265 Subsequently Stone J in Yulianti v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs 2001 FCA 142 agreed with the views expressed by French J and Sackville J Her Honour observed in addition that the grounds for

practical sense the decisionmaker or tribunal lacks the benefit of any binding direction from the court as to precisely what it is that the decisionmaker or tribunal is required to do In the present case the precise concession which led to the proposed consent order had not been communicated by the respondent to the applicant The possibility arose that the matter could have been remitted to the Tribunal with the parties themselves not being ad idem as to the error of law which had led to the decision being set aside and which the Tribunal was required to rectify And even if there had been such an agreement the terms of the order proposed would not have disclosed to the public what the parties had agreed should be its content In the particular case where a tribunal decision is set aside the Tribunal itself is not usually a party and has played no role in the negotiation of the agreement that it erred in law A fortiori in that case the order must be clear and complete and the Court must be satisfied that it is appropriate       It is wellestablished that in making a consent order or indeed in accepting undertakings the Court must have regard to the limits of its power The parties cannot by consent confer power on the Court to make orders which the Court lacks power to make Thomson Australian Holdings Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission  1981  1981 HCA 48  148 CLR 150

effect to the wishes of the parties it is exercising a public function and must have regard to the public interest in doing so see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Real Estate Institute WA Inc 1999 161 ALR 79 at 86 and the authorities referred to there It is important therefore that the Court itself addresses and is satisfied of the basis upon which its order is to be made and in particular where the order sets aside the decision of an official decisionmaker or a tribunal       In the case of error of law attributed to a decisionmaker or tribunal there is a particular public interest which requires the Courts specification of the error and its satisfaction that error occurred   It is also a substantial discourtesy for a court to overturn the decision of an official decisionmaker and a fortiori that of a statutory tribunal without consideration of the error that leads to the decision being overturned or communication of the terms of that error to the decisionmaker or tribunal If such a determination is to be set aside on the basis that it has failed to apply or has misapplied the law whether substantive or procedural there may potentially be some precedential impact in other like cases To permit the principle underlying the order to be formulated only by the parties in their submissions to the decisionmaker or the Tribunal leaves the content

06_107.xml,c7,cited,Peacock v Zyfert (1983) 48 CLR 549,25 I am also satisfied that the erroneous classification of the products amounts to an error of law There has been some debate about whether a mistake as to the ordinary meaning of a word used in a statutory provision can of itself amount to an error of law In Peacock v Zyfert 1983 48 ALR 549 at 564565 Lockhart J said  I now turn to a submission made on behalf of the appellants that the question which was before the Customs for determination in this case was one of fact and that the primary judge erred in treating it as a question of law Reliance was placed upon the principle that where a word is an ordinary English word its meaning is not a question of law and accordingly whether the facts of a given case fall within that meaning is a question of fact Reference was made to Hope v Bathurst City Council 1980 29 ALR 577 at 5802 1980 HCA 16  144 CLR 1 at 68 per Mason J Blackwood Hodge Aust Pty Ltd v Collector of Customs NSW No 2 1980 3 ALD 38 at 4951 per Fisher J and at 556 per Sheppard J and Brutus v Cozens 1972 UKHL 6  1973 AC 854 esp at 861 per Lord Reid where his Lordship said The meaning of an ordinary word of the English language is not a question of law The proper construction of a statute is a question of law If the context shows that a word is used in an unusual sense the court will determine in other words what that unusual sense is  It is for the tribunal which decides the case to consider not as law but as fact whether in the whole circumstances the words of the statute do or do not as a matter of ordinary usage of the English language cover or apply to the facts which have been proved If it is alleged that the tribunal has reached a wrong decision then there can be a question of law but only of a limited character The question would normally be whether their decision was unreasonable in the sense that no tribunal acquainted with the ordinary use of language could reasonably reach that decision   In my opinion this principle has no application in this case If taken to its logical conclusion the appellants argument really asserts that it is for the Customs to say in each case whether any and if so which provision of the Tariff applies to particular goods But it is not a question of the Customs simply determining whether particular goods fall within the meaning of ordinary English words What the Customs would be deciding if the appellants are correct is whether the description of particular goods falls within particular chapters items subitems paragraphs and subparagraphs of the Tariff It must be a question of law whether a given description of goods falls within a particular part of the Tariff Here the question is what particular part of the relevant Schedule if any applies This necessarily involves a question of construction of the Tariff and is a question of law see Whitton v Falkiner 1915 HCA 38  1915 20 CLR 118 per Isaacs J at 127  See also Fox J at 55555627 Subsequently the issue was discussed at some length by Burchett J in Baxter Healthcare Pty Limited v ComptrollerGeneral of Customs 1997 72 FCR 467  Baxter Healthcare  in a most helpful judgment His Honour said at 471472  A preliminary point should be mentioned since it is important although little attention was paid to it in argument Where there is a question whether something falls within a verbal description in a statute as in a case raising the application of a tariff item the answer may depend simply on findings of fact as to the meaning of the words constituting the description and as to the nature of the thing itself With regard to the words the question what is the meaning of an ordinary English word or phrase as used in a Statute is one of fact not of law Australian Gas Light Co v ValuerGeneral 1940 40 SR NSW 126 at 137 per Jordan CJ Nevertheless once the nature of the thing has been found as a fact whether it falls within the verbal description will in many cases be a question of law For in the first place it may not be a matter of applying merely the ordinary English meaning of words or phrases but of applying a meaning derived from the statute by a process of construction which is a process of law Hope v Bathurst City Council 1980 HCA 16  1980 144 CLR 1 at 10 per Mason J with whose reasons Gibbs Stephen and Aickin JJ stated

06_107.xml,c8,cited,Collector of Customs v Agfa-Gevaert Ltd [1996] HCA 36 ; (1996) 186 CLR 389,26 In Collector of Customs v AgfaGevaert Ltd 1996 HCA 36  1996 186 CLR 389 at 396397 the High Court expressed reservations about the supposed distinction between the ordinary meaning of words which is said to raise a question of fact and the construction and effect of a term or provision which is said to raise a question of law The Court said  With respect this distinction seems artificial if not illusory The meaning attributed to individual words in a phrase ultimately dictates the effect or construction that one gives to the phrase when taken as a whole and the approach that one adopts in determining the meaning of the individual words of that phrase is bound up in the syntactical construction of the phrase in question In R v Brown a recent House of Lords decision Lord Hoffmann said    The fallacy in the Crowns argument is I think one common among lawyers namely to treat the words of an English sentence as building blocks whose meaning cannot be affected by the rest of the sentence  This is not the way language works The unit of communication by means of language is the sentence and not the parts of which it is composed The significance of individual words is affected by other words and the syntax of the whole    If the notions of meaning and construction are interdependent as we think they are then it is difficult to see how meaning is a question of fact while construction is a question of law without insisting on some qualification concerning construction that is currently absent from the law  However the Court did not find it necessary to resolve this issue27 Subsequently the issue was discussed at some length by Burchett J in Baxter Healthcare Pty Limited v ComptrollerGeneral of Customs 1997 72 FCR 467  Baxter Healthcare  in a most helpful judgment His Honour said at 471472  A preliminary point should be mentioned since it is important although little attention was paid to it in argument Where there is a question whether something falls within a verbal description in a statute as in a case raising the application of a tariff item the answer may depend simply on findings of fact as to the meaning of the words constituting the description and as to the nature of the thing itself With regard to the words the question what is the meaning of an ordinary English word or phrase as used in a Statute is one of fact not of law Australian Gas Light Co v ValuerGeneral 1940 40 SR NSW 126 at 137 per Jordan CJ Nevertheless once the nature of the thing has been found as a fact whether it falls within the verbal description will in many cases be a question of law For in the first place it may not be a matter of applying merely the ordinary English meaning of words or phrases but of applying a meaning derived from the statute by a process of construction which is a process of law Hope v Bathurst City Council 1980 HCA

a statutory word or expression and that uncertainty can be resolved by construing the word according to its context That process raises a question of law Burchett J explained why this is so in the following passage at 473474   In such a case a court or tribunal does not choose between different possible applications of the one equivocal or inexact statutory concept for example insulting to an evaluation or an appreciation in the French sense see 69 ALJ 984 of the facts but chooses upon the principles of construction between possible concepts conveyed by the statutory expression Of course it is conceivable that a particular provision in an enactment will raise both kinds of problem But Gummow Js remarks in AgfaGevaert Ltd v Collector of Customs seem to me to involve that where the susceptibility of words and expressions to different meanings or shades of meaning is to be resolved by a process of construction of the statutory language in order to determine whether it embraces the facts found the ultimate question is one of law This accords with the view of Fullagar J in Hayes v Commissioner of Taxation Cth  with Hope at 10 and with the joint judgment of Sheppard and Burchett JJ in Australian National Railways Commission v Collector of Customs SA 1985 8 FCR 264 at 277 In Collector of Customs v AgfaGevaert Ltd at 397 the joint judgment of the High Court refers to the principle that the determination of whether an Act uses an expression  in any other sense than that which they have scilicet it has in ordinary speech is always a question of law On that basis logically it must also be a question of law in a case where a statutory expression has several ordinary senses whether it is used in a particular one of them And as the joint judgment of Neaves French and Cooper JJ in Pozzolanic Enterprises points out at 288289 uncertainties may require to be resolved by reference to a value judgment about the range of the Act rather than a matching of the facts to the or an ordinary meaning of the words Their Honours said   Although the words of the statute are construed according to their ordinary English meaning that does not mean that their application to a set of facts is simply described as the matching of that set of facts with a factual description There is necessarily a selection process involved The range of relationships to which the words apply

an ordinary word of the English language is not a question of law The proper construction of a statute is a question of law If the context shows that a word is used in an unusual sense the court will determine in other words what that unusual sense is  It is for the tribunal which decides the case to consider not as law but as fact whether in the whole circumstances the words of the statute do or do not as a matter of ordinary usage of the English language cover or apply to the facts which have been proved If it is alleged that the tribunal has reached a wrong decision then there can be a question of law but only of a limited character The question would normally be whether their decision was unreasonable in the sense that no tribunal acquainted with the ordinary use of language could reasonably reach that decision   In my opinion this principle has no application in this case If taken to its logical conclusion the appellants argument really asserts that it is for the Customs to say in each case whether any and if so which provision of the Tariff applies to particular goods But it is not a question of the Customs simply determining whether particular goods fall within the meaning of ordinary English words What the Customs would be deciding if the appellants are correct is whether the description of particular goods falls within particular chapters items subitems paragraphs and subparagraphs of the Tariff It must be a question of law whether a given description of goods falls within a particular part of the Tariff Here the question is what particular part of the relevant Schedule if any applies This necessarily involves a question of construction of the Tariff and is a question of law see Whitton v Falkiner 1915 HCA 38  1915 20 CLR 118 per Isaacs J at 127

supported the applicants arguments He also advanced an alternative argument He submitted that even if marital status discrimination is not covered by Article 1 of the Convention the application of s 221 of the Sex Discrimination Act to marital status discrimination is within the limits of s 51xxix of the Constitution the external affairs power and thus s 910 of the Act He argued that the proscription of marital status discrimination against women will prevent the perpetuation of negative stereotypes about women and can therefore be seen as a means of  nipping in the bud conduct which may grow into or foster  discrimination against women  within the meaning of Article 1 He referred to Article 5 40 above and cited the decision of a Full Court of this Court in Toben v Jones 2003 FCAFC 137  2003 129 FCR 51555 In Toben the appellant had been found by a determination of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to have engaged in racial vilification contrary to s 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 Cth He contended that provision was invalid because the source of the s 51xxix external affairs power relied on the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination  was concerned with the dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or hatred whereas s 18C was intended only to proscribe acts which could be characterised as expressions of racial hatred In other words as I understand the argument the Act did not give effect to the relevant Convention because it did not go far enough it did not fully implement the Convention56 Carr J with whom Kiefel J agreed at 18 accepted that the Act did not fully implement Article 4 of the Convention because provisions in the Bill which created criminal offences in respect of racial hatred had been rejected by Parliament However his Honour at 20 said that it was clearly consistent with the provisions of the Convention that a State Party should legislate to nip in the bud the doing of offensive insulting humiliating or intimidating public acts which are done because of race colour or national or ethnic origin before such acts can grow into incitement or promotion of racial hatred or discrimination  it is for the legislature to choose the means by which it carries into or gives effect to a treaty 57 As already mentioned the present case is not concerned with the Constitutional validity of s 22 In any event for the reasons given above the Convention with which this case is concerned addresses discrimination against women in the sense defined in Article 1 including discrimination which treats women less favourably than men who have the same marital status But s 22 which applies to discrimination against men or women married or unmarried on the ground of marital status is not so to speak a step along the way to some greater goal concerned with discrimination against women only In so far as s 22 is concerned with stereotypes it is the stereotype that might arise from a person being married or unmarried irrespective of sex58 In Toben the nature of the discrimination racial was the subject of both the Convention and Act the point was that the prohibition in the latter only extended to less severe forms of discriminatory conduct than the former In the present case discrimination on the ground of marital status per se is not some less severe form of discrimination against women The nip in the bud analysis does not apply59 Section 910 speaks of giving effect to the Convention  A major element albeit not the only one of the Convention is the obligation undertaken by States Parties to legislate in a number of areas to proscribe discrimination against women60 Section 22 being legislation and not some other form of governmental activity such as for example public education or governmental employment practices is part of Australias discharge of its obligation to legislate as required by the Convention It is therefore to be construed as prohibiting discrimination against women treating them less favourably than men because they are married The action of the Registrar in the present case had nothing to do with the applicants being a woman Had the applicant been a man the result of the application would have been the same61 Issue i must be resolved in the negative It is not strictly necessary therefore to consider the second issue but since the matter was fully argued I shall proceed to do so62 Ms McLeod submitted that the Registrar contravened s 22 by refusing to consider the application  on its merits  The Registrar should have gone beyond a  blanket refusal  The decision involved an analysis of the factual content the supporting material the weighing of relevant discretionary factors and so on  When it was pointed that this argument did not fit the agreed question Ms McLeod sought the amendment which appears in 8 above

06_1074.xml,c10,cited,Commonwealth v Verwayen [1990] HCA 39 ; (1990) 170 CLR 394,I have not overlooked the expense which CBFC and the CBA have clearly incurred in the proceedings under the Absconding Debtors Act  It was their choice to bring those proceedings They did so to take advantage of the different and lower threshold for a warrant for arrest under the Absconding Debtors Act  They did so in the light of the risk of Mr Sim applying for an order under s 60 of the Bankruptcy Act That he did not bring this application earlier no doubt has increased the costs they have incurred and that is a factor I have put into the balance But I do not consider his defence of the proceedings in the NTSC involved him acting in a manner consistent only with Mr Sim having chosen not to exercise his right to apply under s 60 of the Bankruptcy Act either generally or in the light of the reasons for judgment cf Commonwealth v Verwayen 1990 HCA 39  1990 170 CLR 394 There is also no evidence from CBFC or from the CBA that they continued to conduct the proceedings under the Absconding Debtors act relying upon any assumption of fact induced by Mr Sims continued defence of those proceedingsOne matter which counsel for CBFC and the CBA raised which I reject is that there was insufficient opportunity to make an application to this Court or to the FMC for an order under s 78 of the Bankruptcy Act at or immediately after the hearing of the petition and so the application was made under the Absconding Debtors Act  The Registry of this court is open during normal hours and has an afterhours number It is well known that a judge of the Court can be available at very short notice if necessary to hear any urgent application That is not to say that it was inappropriate to have instituted the proceedings in the NTSC under the Absconding Debtors Act that was a matter for CBFC and the CBA but simply to reject one explanation for having done so The reason for having done so as appears from the transcript of the hearing in the SCNT and in his Honours reasons at 63 is the judicial advantage under the Absconding Debtors Act compared to s 78 of the Bankruptcy Act that as his Honour accepted the Absconding Debtors Act does not require proof that Mr Sim was about to abscond with a view to avoiding payment of his debts However as I have sought to point out that judicial advantage also illustrates a difference from the policy of the Bankruptcy Act in circumstances such as the presentAnother matter raised by counsel for CBFC and the CBA which I reject is that Mr Sim has improperly delayed in making this application In fact he did so within a day of the reasons for judgment of the SCNT being published As the factual issues before his Honour included whether Mr Sim did intend to abscond so as to avoid paying his debts it was sensible for Mr Sim to await the reasons to see what factual finding was made on the issueI have also had regard to Mr Sims preparedness to undertake to the Court to return to Australia by inference within a reasonable time to assist his trustee in the event that he is made bankrupt He is prepared to offer a surety for his return Thomas Winter in the sum of 15000 and Mr Winter too has deposed to his preparedness to offer that surety and to his having assets sufficient to meet it I propose to accept that undertaking but to impose upon Mr Sim the time limit of three calendar months from this date or such later date as may be agreed in writing by his trustee He will upon his return to Australia have to surrender his passport to his trustee His trustee assuming Mr Sim is made bankrupt will then have sufficient time to investigate Mr Sims affairs in such manner as the trustee may consider appropriate and to arrange for Mr Sim to be examined under s 81 of the Bankruptcy Act The trustee will control Mr Sims capacity to travel overseas so as to allow an adequate time to complete with Mr Sim such inquiries as he wishes I am more disposed to accept that undertaking supported by the surety as Mr Sim has extensive family in Australia an elderly parent three children and seven grandchildrenFinally I note largely by way of an aside that the Chief Minister on 22 November 1978 said of the Absconding Debtors Bill   It is really only a power that is exercised when the person will not comply with the order of the court It is virtually imprisonment for contempt of the courts orders not imprisonment for debt  Northern Territory Parliamentary Debates 22 November 1978 p 428432As the decision in the NTSC indicates the power is exercisable in much wider circumstances but for that reason its exercise may be vulnerable to an order under s 60 of the Bankruptcy ActFor those reasons I order under s 601a of the Bankruptcy Act that upon the written undertaking of Mr Sim to the Court to be filed in a form approved by the District Registrar that in the event that a sequestration order is made against his estate he will return to Australia within three calendar months of the making of the sequestration order and will cooperate with his trustee in respect of all inquiries and procedures which his trustee requires in relation to his bankruptcy and upon Thomas Harry Edward winter providing to and filing in the Court a surety in the sum of 15000 in a form approved by the District Registrar to the effect that in the event that Mr Sim does not fully comply in every respect with his undertaking Mr Winter will forfeit to the Crown the sum of 15000 and that process may be executed against his property for the said sum of 15000 the orders of the NTSC made on 10 July 2006 and extended on 4 August 2006 under the Absconding Debtors Act in respect of Mr Sim be discharged

06_1077.xml,c4,referred_to,The Queen v Ross-Jones; Ex parte Green [1984] HCA 82 ; (1984) 156 CLR 185,14 On 18 May 2006 Mrs Edge issued proceedings in the Family Court of Australia against the trustee and the bankrupt seeking certain orders under the Family Law Act 1975 Cth the Family Law Act  During the course of the submissions on the application counsel for Mrs Edge indicated that the orders sought in the proceedings in the Family Court may need to be amended After the submissions a member of the firm of solicitors acting for Mrs Edge filed an affidavit in which it is said that Mrs Edge has amended the application in the proceedings in the Family Court in terms of the orders sought Subject to the question of costs I am prepared to decide this application on the basis of the orders sought in the amended application Those orders are as follows   1 That pursuant to section 443 of the Family Law Act 1975  leave of the Court be granted to institute proceedings for the orders applied for hereinafter       2 That pursuant to section 78 of the Family Law Act 1975 a declaration be made that        21 Pursuant to section 90KA of the Family Law Act 1975  the Binding Financial Agreement entered into between the husband and wife on 22 May 2003 is valid and binding and           22 The transfers executed on 18 and 19 September 2002 respectively pursuant to the Binding Financial Agreement entered into between the husband and wife on 22 May 2003 are valid and binding           23 In the alternative to 22 that the transfers effected on 18 and 19 September 2002 respectively were in contemplation of the Binding Financial Agreement entered into between the husband and wife on 22 May 2003 and thus valid and binding           24 As a consequence thereof the wife is entitled to be and remain registered as the sole proprietor both at law and in equity of the properties situate at and known as 68 Range Road North Upper Hermitage in the State of South Australia being all the land comprised in Certificate of Title Volume 5711 Folio 494 and 32  33 Pelican Point Morgan in the State of South Australia being all the land comprised in Certificate of Title Volume 5203 folio 799

75 to the applicant wife and 25 to the respondent husband       5 That the husbands Trustee in Bankruptcy PETER IVAN MACKS be substituted as the Respondent in these proceedings in respect of the husbands property that may vest in the Trustee in Bankruptcy15 The trustee submits that insofar as an order is sought under s 791 of the Family Law Act  the application is out of time and it will be necessary for Mrs Edge to obtain an extension of time I have no information before me as to whether an extension of time will be granted and I think it is appropriate to proceed on the basis that it may be granted16 Significant amendments were made to the Bankruptcy Act and Family Law Act by the Bankruptcy and Family Law Legislation Amendment Act 2005 Cth I will refer to this Act as the Amending Act In terms of the issues in this case it was not suggested that the relevant provisions of the Amending Act did not apply by reason of the fact that the relevant provisions came into effect during the course of 2005 I note that the amendments in Schedule 1 came into operation on 18 September 2005 those in Schedule 2 on 18 March 2005 and the balance on 15 April 200517 In order to explain the effect of the Amending Act on the legal rights and interests between a nonbankrupt spouse and the trustee in bankruptcy of a bankrupt spouse it is necessary to briefly examine the position before that Act For present purposes the previous position may be summarised as follows18 First s 1202 excludes from the operation of subsection 1 among other things a transfer to meet all or part of a liability under a maintenance agreement Before 15 April 2005 maintenance agreement was defined to include a financial agreement within the meaning of the Family Law Act  A similar exclusion or exception applied in relation to other provisions in the Bankruptcy Act  but it was not an exclusion or exception in the case of the operation of s 121 where the main purpose of the transfer was to prevent the transferred property from becoming divisible among the transferors creditors or to hinder or delay the process of making property available for division among the transferors creditors s 1236 Before the introduction of the Amending Act Mrs Edge could have raised as a defence or exception to the trustees claim under s 120 but not s 121 an allegation that the transfers were to meet liabilities under a financial agreement23 In The Queen v RossJones Ex parte Green 1984 HCA 82  1984 156 CLR 185 Wilson and Dawson JJ said at 211 footnotes omitted  We should add that even if those proceedings were a matrimonial cause the Family Court would nevertheless lack the power to grant the relief sought Apart from any constitutional limitation it is now authoritatively established that as a matter of construction the general powers of the Family Court are to be understood in the context of the Family Law Act which confers jurisdiction upon the Court in matrimonial causes and associated matters Those powers which include the power to grant injunctive relief under s 114  are not to be construed so as to confer jurisdiction to defeat the rights or enlarge the obligations of persons who are not parties to the marriage involved in the relevant matrimonial cause Ascot Investments Pty Ltd v Harper    The principle referred to in the above passages has been applied in a number of cases in this Court and in particular it was applied in a context involving the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Swain 1988 20 FCR 507 Davies Lockhart and Burchett JJ said at 514  A sequestration order reflects a right of a creditor and creates rights as between a debtor and his creditors and trustee The Family Court in the pursuit of its duty in an appropriate case to adjust rights as between the parties to a marriage has no power to deprive other parties of their rights Its power to deal with the property of the parties over whom it has jurisdiction must start

06_1080.xml,c4,distinguished,Ta Ho Ma Pty Ltd v Allen [1999] NSWCA 202 ; (1999) 47 NSWLR 1,In support of the motions reliance was placed on the decision of the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Ta Ho Ma Pty Ltd v Allen 1999 NSWCA 202  1999 47 NSWLR 1 Senior counsel referred to what was said by Giles JA said at 17   So a valuer who puts out a negligent valuation does not incur an open ended liability to any and every financier who relies on it even if it was reasonably foreseeable that the financer would rely on it The particular financier may be outside the class of person to whom the valuer owes a duty to take care in making the statement in the valuation in the same manner as Esanda was outside the class of persons to whom the auditors owed a duty of care on the case as pleaded in Esanda Finance Corporation Ltd v Peat Marwick Hungerfords 1997 HCA 8  1997 188 CLR 241 the auditors owed a duty of care to the members of Excel but not to EsandaIn Ta Ho Ma an owner of property obtained a valuation from the defendant Some 812 months later the owner telephoned a solicitor apparently not the owners own solicitor seeking a loan and advising of the valuation The solicitor in turn contacted the plaintiff who advanced a loan on the basis of the defendants valuation which by this time was 912 months old The Court of Appeal held that the defendant owed no duty of care to the plaintiff because having regard to the age of the valuation there could be no expectation of reasonable reliance by the plaintiff see per Handley JA at 1214 per Giles JA at 18 24 28 per Sheppard AJA at 105The case is certainly not authority for any proposition that a valuer only owes a duty of care to the client who directly retains him or her If that were the law there would have been a short answer to the plaintiffs claim since the chain went from valuer defendant to owner to solicitor to lender plaintiff On the facts as Handley JA noted at 6 it was not a case where the valuer contemplated that a class of persons might rely on his valuation Giles JA at 24 pointed out that where a valuer puts out a negligent valuation the class of persons to whom the duty of care   will normally be confined apart from any other considerations to those persons whom the valuer knows or ought to know will reasonably rely on the valuation Emphasis in original  In other words given expectation of reasonable reliance there can be a duty owed by a valuer to a class of persons The identification of that class will obviously depend on the circumstances  23 Perre  a decision of the High Court handed down shortly after Ta Ho Ma demonstrates the flexibility and pragmatism of the law of negligence in identifying the class of persons to whom a duty of care is owed in a particular case and the absence of any bright line rule see per Gleeson CJ at 7 It was held that the defendant which brought infected seed potatoes on to a farm in South Australia owed a duty of care to growers within 20 kilometres of the farm because such persons would be prevented by Western Australian law from exporting potatoes to that State The plaintiffs were members of a class whose members whether numerous or not were ascertainable by the defendant per McHugh J at 50 As I have said it is arguable that in the present case there was an identifiable class constituted by clients of Boyds on whose behalf that firm was seeking the valuations in connection with some commercial dealing involving the specified properties The disclaimers are not conclusive if as a matter of fact the valuers must be taken to have expected that such clients of Boyds would reasonably rely on the valuations Otherwise one might ask what would be the point of obtaining the valuations It was also argued that the allegations of reliance were mere statements of conclusion However reliance can be inferred from the representations contained in the valuations and the applicants purchase of the properties Gould v Vaggelas 1985 HCA 75  1985 157 CLR 215 at 230 Henderson v Amadio No1 1995 62 FCR 1 at 166 Hanave Pty Ltd v LFOT Pty Ltd 1999 43 IPR 545 at 45 To the extent that such authorities deal with proof of reliance in the context of causation there is no logical ground why the reasoning should not apply where reliance is an element in the establishment of a duty of care On behalf of Mantach it was submitted that the pleading does not identify the qualities and standards by which it says that only 359 ha of Broadmoor was available for cropping This seems to be a matter of evidence In this context it would seem that pyrethrum is the kind of cropping referred to The particulars of negligence are reasonably specific and do contrary to the submissions on behalf of Mantach identify the basis upon which it is alleged that the firm departed from the standard of care required of an expert in arriving at an opinion In particular it appears to be alleged that the valuers failed to independently check the cropping area and simply relied on the vendors The motions will be dismissed with costs Counsel for the applicant conceded that some formal amendments may be needed to the

06_1086.xml,c1,applied,NAWZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 199,Driver FM further found that in any event relief should be refused because the applicant had engaged in a scheme with an unknown person in order to mislead and deceive the Minister amounting to misconduct and the applicant should not enjoy the fruits of this scheme Driver FM cited NAWZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs 2004 FCAFC 199 in support of this propositionLimitations of time in respect of filing and serving notices of appeal of decisions of the Federal Magistrates Court in the Federal Court are set out in O 52 r 15 Federal Court Rules  The rule provides   1 The notice of appeal shall be filed and served     a within 21 days after       i the date when the judgment appealed from was pronounced  ii the date when leave to appeal was granted or  iii any later date fixed for that purpose by the court appealed from or      b within such further time as is allowed by the Court or a Judge upon application made by motion upon notice filed within the period of 21 days referred to in the last preceding paragraph    2 Notwithstanding anything in the preceding subrule the Court or a Judge for special reasons may at any time give leave to file and serve a notice of appealThe applicant in this case did not apply to the Court within 21 days of the judgment of Driver FM The decision of Driver FM was handed down on 13 March 2006 and the application for an extension of time was filed in this Court on 5 April 2005 two days outside the timeframe It follows that the applicant is required to seek the leave of this Court pursuant to O 52 r 152 to file and serve a notice of appealThe first respondent in written and oral submissions asserted that  the court below did not err in concluding that the protection visa application was valid notwithstanding that the applicant has signed it in a false name and made false claims citing NAWZ  the court below never had jurisdiction so its order to dismiss the application with costs was an appropriate order  alternatively if the court below did have jurisdiction there was no error in concluding that the protection visa application was valid and as such the application should have been dismissed with costs  even if the court below had jurisdiction and the protection visa application was invalid relief should have been refused anyway given that the applicant had knowingly participated in a deception of the ministerThe submissions of the applicant and the submissions of the first respondent are somewhat divergent The applicant has directed his submissions including assertions in his affidavit of 5 April 2006 and his oral submissions towards the delay in filing his notice of appeal and addressing the decision of the Tribunal The first respondent has focussed on the issue of the validity of the protection visa application and the validity of the decision of the Tribunal as determined by Driver FMThe case before Driver FM was determined by his Honour on the issue of the validity of the visa application and the Tribunal hearing I have briefly recounted the reasons for this in this judgment Driver FM explains the background in more detail in his judgment In this case the applicant sought a show cause order in the Federal Magistrates Court pursuant to r 4412 Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 which is as follows    Show cause hearing    1 At a hearing of an application for an order to show cause the Court may      a if it is not satisfied that the application has raised an arguable case for the relief claimed  dismiss the application or  b if it is satisfied that the application has raised an arguable case for the relief claimed  adjourn the proceeding and order a respondent to show cause at a final hearing why an order for the relief claimed should not be made on such of the grounds mentioned in the application as are specified by the Court or  c without making an order under paragraph b make final orders in relation to the claims for relief and grounds mentioned in the application      2 To avoid doubt a dismissal under paragraph 1a is interlocutoryHearing the application on 27 February 2006 it appears his Honour dismissed the application insofar as it attacked the merits of the Tribunal decision As clear from r 44122 that decision was interlocutory His Honour went on however to grant the application in relation to the validity of the protection visa application and the Tribunal decision which the learned Federal Magistrate heard on 13 March 2006The applicant could have sought leave to appeal the decision of Driver FM of 27 February 2006 in relation to the dismissal of the show cause application relevant to the merits of the Tribunal decision He did not do so and is not doing so now Instead he lodged an amended application in the Federal Magistrates Court as already discussed Unfortunately from the grounds which have been put before me in this matter it is possible that the applicant did not understand that his Honour was dismissing that part of his applicationTo that extent submissions of the applicant in relation to the merits of the Tribunal decision and why he was unsuccessful before the Tribunal are not relevant in this case I note for the benefit of the applicant that this Court has a limited jurisdiction in reviewing decisions of the Tribunal and in fact has no jurisdiction to review findings of fact by the Tribunal nor investigate the merits of the applicants claim except to the extent that errors of law may be demonstrated I also note however although this does not form part of my decision that the Tribunal appeared to give careful consideration to the claims of the applicant including giving him the benefit of the doubt in respect of a number of his claims but nonetheless affirmed the decision not to grant a protection visa for reasons stated in their Decision RecordIn relation to the submissions of the respondent the decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court in NAWZ is applicable Although made in the context of s 98 of the Act I note in particular comments of their Honours at par 18   We do not consider that the irregular manner of filling in and signing of the false application resulted in the invalidity of the application It was a false application but it was in formal terms a valid applicationIn this case the applicant had completed an application for a protection visa under a false name and signed it As Driver FM pointed out that fact alone does not render the application invalid it was the applicants application regardless of what name he chose to use on it and it was a complete application regardless of whether the claims and other details in it were true or false Further in my view it would be contrary to public policy to allow the applicant to claim that the process of lodgement of a protection visa was flawed because he had lodged the first application under a false name for whatever reason cf NAWZ at par 14Accordingly on this reasoning both the decision of the delegate of the Minister and the Tribunal were valid

Commissioner may defer exercising his discretion until the outcome of a Part IVC decision is knownKenny J concluded on this issue at 6970   In this case the Commissioner apparently considers that depending upon the outcome of the Pt IVC proceeding and the objection process it may well be appropriate for him to issue a further amended assessment in consequence of the need to make a compensatory adjustment or otherwise to give effect to the decision of the Court It does not follow from this however that the amended assessment is tentative or provisional in the Hoffnung sense To adopt what Hill J said in McCleary at 322     In summary it can be said that the conclusion that an assessment is tentative will ordinarily emerge from an examination of the assessment itself as in Hoffnung  The mere indication that an assessment will be reviewed later does not require the conclusion that the assessment is tentative  Nor will an assessment be regarded as tentative in the relevant sense even if two assessments have been issued to different taxpayers concerning the same income with the consequence that one of them must necessarily be reduced to nil Richard Walter  Provided the notice of assessment purports to create a definitive liability and at least there is no evidence to the contrary the assessment will not be tentative   Emphasis in original     In the present case the evidence falls short of demonstrating that the amended assessment in question was tentative or provisional It is not to be treated as tentative simply because officers of the Commissioner contemplated that it might be the subject of a compensatory adjustment in the future or may not entirely survive a proceeding under Pt IVCFinally her Honour acquitted the Commissioner of bad faith no concession having been made that he assessed the Bank on facts known to be wrong She went on to observe at 73   But even on the assumption that the Commissioner knew that he might have proceeded in error and that ANZ might succeed in the Pt IVC proceeding in showing the amended assessment is excessive I would not infer bad faith on the Commissioners part Even if the Commissioners approach is erroneous I accept that for the reasons given by his counsel it would be open to the Commissioner to take the view that his approach is necessary to protect the revenue and that any unfairness to ANZ can be remedied at the end of the objection review and appeal processes Emphasis in originalAs I earlier indicated Futuris has submitted that ANZ Banking Group is distinguishable s 177F3 cannot be relied upon by the Commissioner in the present matter to correct the figures stated in the Second Amended Assessment and that the Commissioner deliberately stated amounts in that assessment which he knew to be incorrectFuturis accepts that in ANZ Banking Group  s 177F3a clearly authorised the making of a compensation adjustment for the reason that it was the implementation of the scheme in that case which led to the inclusion in the Banks assessable income of the amount of 29 million pursuant to s 251The Commissioners contention it is said is that for s 177F3 purposes the amount of 19950088 which was included in the First Amended Assessment would not have been included in the assessable income of Futuris if the Part IVA scheme had not been carried out Of this Futuris submits that    53 The difficulty which the Commissioners view encounters is that he contends that the Pt IVA scheme comprised those events which increased the cost base of the Walshville shares by the amount of 82950088 by a transaction which attracted the operation of the antiavoidance provisions of Division 19A In essence the Commissioner characterises the Pt IVA scheme as a scheme to obtain a cost base transfer in the amount of 82950088 thus increasing the cost base of the Walshville shares by that amount and reducing the net capital gain by the same amount   54 Consequently the effect of the two amended assessments may be summarised as follows       a by the First Amended Assessment the Commissioner contends that the scheme had the consequence that Division 19A operated to increase the cost base of the Bristile shares by an amount of only 63M that is 19950088 less than Futuris contends and   b by the Second Amended Assessment the Commissioner contends in the alternative that Pt IVA operated effectively to eliminate the entire cost base transfer of 82950088 contended for by Futuris       55 Thus it can be seen that the Commissioners contentions are truly alternative in respect of the amount of 19950088 With respect to that amount the Commissioner relies on one or other of Division 19A or Pt IVA but not both   56 Returning to address the potential application of s 177F3a the Commissioner was incorrect on the view that it would supply a basis for making a  compensating adjustment  Paragraph 177F3a could only apply if       a the First Amended Assessment reflects the inclusion of a net capital gain in the assessable income of Futuris and   b that net capital gain would not have been included in the assessable income of Futuris if the Pt IVA scheme had not been carried out       57 However the Commissioners contention is in fact to the opposite effect The Commissioner contends that the amount of 19950088 would have been included in the assessable income of Futuris if the scheme had not been carried out He has assessed under Pt IVA on the contention that but for the scheme the amount of 82950088 would have been included in the assessable income of FuturisThe Commissioners response to this is that the present matter is relevantly indistinguishable from ANZ Banking Group  In that case by virtue of the scheme 29 million was included in the taxpayers assessable income irrespective of Part IVA  in consequence of s 251 of the ITAA Here by virtue of the scheme approximately 19 million was included in Futuris assessable income irrespective of Part IVA  in consequence of Division 19A In ANZ Banking Group the tax benefit for s 177F1 and s 177C1a purposes was the 65 million here it was 82 million If the scheme in ANZ Banking Group had not been carried out the 29 million would not have been included in the Banks assessable income here if the Walshville float scheme had not been carried out 19 million as assessed would not have been included in Futuris assessable income There is simply no reason it is said to give s 177F3 the construction contended for by Futuris In the Commissioners view both ANZ Banking Group and the present matter have alternative bases for including the erroneously described double sums in the respective taxpayers assessable income However the Commissioner goes on to say that given the present uncertainty as to how the 19 million was calculated it may be that the two bases may in fact be found in this case to be cumulative The Part IVC proceedings in relation to the First Amended Assessment will clarify that situationFor my own part I agree with the Commissioners submission The present matter is one which falls naturally within both the language and the evident purpose of s 177F3 But even if I am wrong in this I equally am satisfied that at best all that Futuris has shown is that in making a definitive assessment ie the Second Amended Assessment see below the Commissioner proceeded upon a mistaken view of the applicability of s 177F3 That mistake did not invalidate the assessment or evidence bad faith on the Commissioners part in the exercise of the power to assess The effect of the mistake could and should properly be addressed in Part IVC proceedingsOn the material before the Court I am not satisfied that the Commissioner deliberately engaged in what the applicant calls double counting When the Part IVA determinations were made the Commissioner could then have made a s 177F1 determination to include only part of the tax benefit in Futuris assessable income ie 82 million  19 million Rather in view of the facts as he then understood them to be he chose to include the totality of the benefit in the knowledge that there was some likelihood of the need later to make a compensating adjustment This was a course he was entitled to take in the circumstances given that a the Division 19A proceedings in respect of the First Amended Assessment had not been determined b there was uncertainty about how the 19 million was calculated in any event and c his view that there was a need to protect the revenue by making the Second Amended Assessment as he did

MEINHARDTSecond RespondentVICTORIA BARBARA TREYVAUDThird Respondent  JUDGE  JESSUP J DATE 22 AUGUST 2006 PLACE MELBOURNE  RULING    William Lindsay Meinhardt died on 23 November 2003 leaving a will which named Timonthy Jonathan Browne and Roderick Charles McKenzie as executors The residuary beneficiaries were William Meinhardts three children Victoria Treyvaud Sally Veall and William Edward Meinhardt No application for probate had been made when on 23 November 2005 William Meinhardt Jr commenced proceedings in the Supreme Court of Victoria against the executors under s 15 of the Administration and Probate Act 1958 Vic in which they sought orders that the executors show cause why they should not renounce probate of the will and why administration of the will should not be granted to State Trustees Ltd On 22 December 2005 the executors commenced their own proceeding in the Supreme Court in which they applied for probate of the will On 16 March 2006 the Supreme Court ordered that the two proceedings be heard togetherIn the course of interlocutory proceedings in the Federal Magistrates Court it became apparent that it would be contended that the commencement of this proceeding was not regular in the absence of leave having been granted for the presentation of the petition pursuant to subs 13 of s 244  which provides as follows   Where proceedings have been commenced in a court for the administration of a deceased persons estate under a law of a State or Territory a petition for an order under this section in relation to the estate shall not be presented by a creditor except by leave of the Court and on such terms and conditions if any as the Court thinks fit  It also became apparent that reliance would be placed upon the judgment of this Court in Gonzalez v Maria de Luz Marmentini Executrix of the Estate of the late Ida Garcia Raber an unreported judgment of Emmet J given on 7 July 1998 I shall refer to that judgment further below it being sufficient here to relate that the Federal Magistrates Court considered it more appropriate that the argument whether that judgment was plainly wrong if there were to be such an argument should be had in this Court rather than in that Court For this and other reasons to which that Court referred on 19 July 2006 the proceeding was transferred to this CourtThe parties argued the question of the applicability of s 24413 of the Bankruptcy Act as a preliminary point It was submitted by Mr Bigmore QC who appeared with Mr Lyons for William Meinhardt Jr that the applicant required the leave of the Court before presenting the petition which it had purported to present on 1 May 2006 although he accepted that if that leave were now to be sought and granted the grant could validly operate nunc pro tunc Mr Sifris QC who appeared with Mr Fary for the applicant submitted that leave was not required in the circumstances of this case Mr Foster the solicitor for Victoria Treyvaud made submissions on some legal issues arising without indicating any particular position with respect to the application of subs 13 in the circumstancesThe burden of Mr Bigmores submission was that the Supreme Court proceedings to which I have referred are either separately or taken together proceedings  in a court for the administration of a deceased persons estate under a law of a State or Territory within the meaning of subs 13 Mr Sifris took issue with that proposition contending that the Supreme Court proceedings were concerned only with identifying and empowering according to law the person or persons who would thereafter be responsible for the administration of the estate of William Meinhardt Sr He relied upon the judgment in Gonzalez in support of the proposition that the administration to which subs 13 refers is a general administration of the whole estate of the kind that was once done in Chancery or a more limited analogue of that description of administration for which for example Pt 54 of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Victoria now providesThe one Ace which Mr Sifris had in his hand was the judgment of Emmet J in Gonzales to which I have referred In the facts which led to that judgment the executrix was granted probate of the will of the deceased on 6 August 1997 On 6 April 1998 a creditor filed a petition under s 244 of the Bankruptcy Act for the administration of the deceased estate in bankruptcy It was contended that subs 13 operated as a bar to the presentation of the petition The response to this was that s 24413 referred only to proceedings in the nature of a general administration and was inapplicable where the only proceedings were those which had lead to the grant of probate Emmet J accepted that response He said that the purpose of s 24413 was to ensure that there are not two courts administering an insolvent estate or administering the estate generally His Honour referred to Pt 68 of the NSW Supreme Court Rules corresponding to Pt 54 of the Victorian Supreme Court Rules  and continued   It is an order such as is contemplated by Pt68 of the Supreme Court Rules which I consider was in contemplation when s 24413 was enacted Administration suits in Australia are in fact rare for the reasons which I have briefly indicated The purpose of s 24413 is to ensure that where an order for the administration of an estate has been made by the Supreme Court of a State or Territory the effect of which is to prevent any dealings with the estate otherwise than under the direction of the Court the Bankruptcy Court will not in conflict with such an order seek to administer the estate  His honour also referred to s 2449 which he noted suggested that the statutory draftsman had in mind that subs 13 would not apply to every application for the grant of probateMr Bigmore dealt with Gonzalez at two levels First he submitted that Gonzalez was concerned with a situation in which the probate proceedings in the Supreme Court had been completed by the time the s 244 petition was presented On his construction of subs 13 the opening words where proceedings have been commenced carry the sense of proceedings which have been commenced but remain pending as at the date of the presentation of the bankruptcy petition Mr Bigmore said that Emmet Js judgment was correct on the facts before him since the probate proceedings in the Supreme Court were well concluded before the bankruptcy proceedings commenced in this Court He submitted accordingly that Gonzalez should be distinguishedI do not think that Gonzalez may be distinguished in this way It is not a situation in which an earlier case has been decided a particular way because of a fact or circumstance which does not exist in the instant case It is rather a situation in which an earlier case has been decided by reference to a particular rule or proposition whereas it might equally have been decided the same way by reference to a different rule or proposition having application to facts or circumstances which differ from those existing in the instant case In the latter situation the rule or proposition by reference to which the earlier case was in fact decided constitutes its ratio decidendi It is true of course that the ratio decidendi of a decided case extends no further than the rules and propositions which were essential for the course of reasoning which led the case to be decided in the way that it was However this does not justify a later court in effectively deconstructing the earlier courts process of reasoning by postulating a more limited basis upon which the earlier case might have been but was not decidedMr Bigmores second submission was that Gonzalez was plainly wrong He accepted that I should follow the judgment of another single judge of this Court unless I was persuaded that it was plainly wrong see Cooper v Commissioner of Taxation 2004 FCA 1063  2004 139 FCR 205 46 Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v

that the error must be manifest or if it does not rise to that level at least capable of being easily demonstrated In a sense the error must be so clear as to enable a later court to say that the point is not reasonably arguableI am a considerable distance from forming the view that the judgment in Gonzalez was wrong much less plainly wrong In the circumstances I am bound to follow and I do follow the judgment in Gonzalez  It follows that I rule that there is nothing in s 24413 of the Bankruptcy Act which would constitute a bar to the commencement to this proceeding    I certify that the

RespondentVICTORIA BARBARA TREYVAUDThird Respondent  JUDGE  JESSUP J DATE 22 AUGUST 2006 PLACE MELBOURNE  RULING    William Lindsay Meinhardt died on 23 November 2003 leaving a will which named Timonthy Jonathan Browne and Roderick Charles McKenzie as executors The residuary beneficiaries were William Meinhardts three children Victoria Treyvaud Sally Veall and William Edward Meinhardt No application for probate had been made when on 23 November 2005 William Meinhardt Jr commenced proceedings in the Supreme Court of Victoria against the executors under s 15 of the Administration and Probate Act 1958 Vic in which they sought orders that the executors show cause why they should not renounce probate of the will and why administration of the will should not be granted to State Trustees Ltd On 22 December 2005 the executors commenced their own proceeding in the Supreme Court in which they applied for probate of the will On 16 March 2006 the Supreme Court ordered that the two proceedings be heard togetherIn the period leading to about the middle of the nineteenth century in England the Court of Chancery exercised a jurisdiction whereby it undertook the general administration of a trust or a deceased estate A decree for general administration was made as of course upon application by a beneficiary The history of the proceeding is set out in the judgment of Young J in McLean v Burns Philp Trustee Co Pty Ltd 1985  2 NSWLR 623 His Honour said at 633   By 1850 the law was that if any beneficiary came to the court at all and asked for general administration general administration would be decreed as of course The court would order that the trust was to be specifically performed under its supervision that nothing was to be done without its imprimatur that accounts should be taken to see what the trust assets were and the court would give directions as to how the trust would be carried out I have also been referred to Williams Mortimer and Sunnucks  Executors Administrators and Probate 18 th ed  2000 In that edition the authors say at p38   In the nineteenth century the main business of the Chancery Masters was the administration of the estates of deceased persons It was common for estates to be administered in Chancery and testators sometimes even directed in their wills that the estate should be so administered If the assistance of the court was required the only relief available was the making of a full administration order This terminated the authority of the representative to administer and put the whole of the administration in the hands of the court a necessarily expensive and slow matter A full administration order required and still requires if one were to be made accounts to be taken of the testators debts and of his property come to the hands of the representatives and an inquiry as to what part of his property was outstanding or undisposed of and whether it was subject to incumbrances There was and theoretically still is machinery for advertising for creditors requiring creditors to come in and prove their claims and for examining the representatives accountsFor reasons explained both by Young J and by Williams et al  proceedings for the general administration of trusts became increasingly less frequent in the second half of the nineteenth century and are today all but unknown There is a simpler and more flexible procedure under which a beneficiary may obtain particular relief in relation to a deceased estate or a trust without the need to place the whole estate or trust under the general administration of the court In Victoria that procedure is established by Pt 54 of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Victoria  However courts of equity retain their jurisdiction to make general administration decrees even if the existence of that jurisdiction may be regarded in contemporary times as theoretical Indeed in McLean itself although Young J ultimately did not make the interlocutory general administration order which had been sought in the proceedings before him his refusal to do so depended in no sense upon a view that jurisdiction was lacking or that an order for general administration could no longer be made by a court of equityIn the proceedings before me Mr Sifris argued that a proceeding for administration by the court of either the traditional general kind or the more flexible and specific kind for which Pt 54 of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Victoria provides is the kind of proceeding to which s 24413 of the Bankruptcy Act refers He said that a proceeding of this kind was conformable with the natural meaning of the phrase proceedings  in a court for the administration of a deceased persons estateMr Bigmore submitted that so to construe subs 13 was to narrow down the natural meaning of the words found therein without any apparent grammatical or contextual justification While accepting as I understood him that the subsection did extend to proceedings for general administration or under Pt 54  he submitted that the natural meaning of the words extended also to a situation in which someone had applied for a grant of probate or for letters of administration in relation to a deceased estate In these situations the estate would be administered by or under the direction of the person to whom the grant had been made and proceedings in a court were necessary to obtain the grant

06_1112.xml,c0,followed,ACD Tridon v Tridon Australia [2002] NSWSC 896,Comandate Marine argued that the making of a choice between having disputes determined by arbitration or curially was not an election by a party to an arbitration agreement It relied on what Austin J had said in ACD Tridon v Tridon Australia 2002 NSWSC 896 at 58  6869 He held that mere delay in invoking a reference to arbitration by a party to an arbitration agreement who had been sued by the other party in curial proceedings was not an election or waiver see too Australian Granites Ltd v Eisenwerk Hensel Bayreuth Dipling Burkhardt GmbH 2001 1 Qd R 461 at 469 25 But that is quite distinct from the position here where the party asserting the binding obligation to arbitrate later initiated the Boomerang I s arrest without at that time seeking or foreshadowing a claim for curial assistance in those proceedings in enforcing the arbitration agreement
06_1112.xml,c1,discussed,Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch & Lomb Inc (1985) 7 ATPR SS40 -636,As noted above Comandate Marines proceedings in rem contained no such request And Art 81 of the Model Law relevantly requires a court in which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement to refer the parties to arbitration if a party so requests no later than when submitting its first statement on the substance of the dispute 59 Russell on Arbitration 22 nd ed at 610 A5018 refers to Art 81 having the same effect as English law ie the party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement must apply to the court without delay for a stay of the proceedings op cit at 296 7005 The position is similar under s 532 of the Commercial Arbitration Act 1984 NSW which applies here by force of s 79 of the Judiciary Act 1903 Cth Comandate Marine did not apply to have its proceedings referred to arbitration when they were before this Court or the High Court I am of opinion that Comandate Marines conduct in bringing its proceedings in rem was incompatible with the arbitration agreement and that Art 81 and Art 9 of the Model Law do not avail it Comandate Marine is in a similar position to that of the landlord in the example given by Parker J in Matthews v Smallwood 1910 1 Ch at 786787 By pleading the writ in the way which it did Comandate Marine exercised a right of action given by the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth to litigate the breach of the charter party as a general maritime claim under s 43f of the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth in this Court I am of opinion that in choosing to claim only that relief when it invoked the jurisdiction of the Court Comandate Marine could not do that without prejudice to any right it might otherwise have had to seek security for the arbitration under s 29 at a later stage It made no such claim in the writ and it procured the arrest of the vessel for the purposes of the particular relief which it claimed in the writ The way in which Comandate Marine framed its claim in the writ nailed its colours to the mast as much as the warrant for arrest later was nailed notionally or actually to the mast of the Boomerang I  Having invoked the jurisdiction of the Court to procure the arrest of the vessel in order to pursue the only claims it pleaded it is not open to Comandate Marine now to say that it did so without prejudice to any right later to apply for security under s 29 of the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth In its report Civil Admiralty Jurisdiction Report No 33 1986 Law Reform Commission Australia the Commission recommended the introduction of what has become s 29 so as to enable the Admiralty jurisdiction to be used to obtain and retain security even though the merits of the dispute are to be determined elsewhere if the subject matter of the dispute lies within Admiralty jurisdiction The Commission noted that such a solution would do most to ensure that the award of the tribunal that decides upon the merits is satisfied and hence that a just result would be obtained It noted that the law had a strong interest in compliance with arbitral awards duly made and in achieving cooperation between courts and arbitrators to this end However the Commission desired in the solution it proposed that the Court should retain a discretion to stay or to exercise jurisdiction to decide the merits ALRC 33 189 That discretion was to arise in the Court being able to take into account all relevant circumstances although the Commission noted that as at 1986 English and South African courts required the plaintiff to demonstrate why the assistance of a court was required in retaining security although there were shades of difference between the readiness of the respective jurisdictions to assist in respect of claims otherwise unconnected with the forum The Tuyuti 1984 QB 838 at 851 Katagum Wholesale Commodities v The MV Paz 1984 3 SAf LR 261 at 268 270 Natal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa Neither party argued that the analysis of the present question should be approached on the basis that there had been a contract of abandonment such as in Paal Wilson  Co AS v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal 1983 1 AC 854 at 915916 There Lord Diplock considered that abandonment of a contract which was still executory involved the formation of a contract of abandonment in which each party promised to release the other from performance of all further obligations including the obligation to pay damages for past breaches arising under the executory and now abandoned contract Lord Brandon of Oakbrook who gave the leading speech see 1983 1 AC 900C per Lord Diplock said that the question of whether a contract has been abandoned or not is one of fact 1983 1 AC at 913F He continued 1983 1 AC at 914AC   The concept of the implied abandonment of a contract as a result of the conduct of the parties to it is well established in law  see Chitty on Contracts  23 rd ed 1968 vol 1 p 577 para 1231 and cases there cited Where A seeks to prove that he and B have abandoned a contract in this way there are two ways in which A can put his case The first way is by showing that the conduct of each party as evinced to the other party and acted on by him leads necessarily to the inference of an implied agreement between them to abandon the contract The second method is by showing that the conduct of B as evinced towards A has been such as to lead A reasonably to believe that B has abandoned the contract even though it has not in fact been Bs intention to do so and that A has significantly altered his position in reliance on that belief The first method involves actual abandonment by both A and B The second method involves the creation by B of a situation in which he is estopped from asserting as against A that he B has not abandoned the contract  Pearl Mill Co v Ivy Tannery Co Ltd 1919 1 KB 78    This contractual analysis is inapposite here but their Lordships approach shows that notwithstanding that arbitration proceedings have been regularly commenced and that both parties are bound to their pursuit the conduct of one party or both parties can bring about the legal consequence that the parties obligations to arbitrate in the arbitration proceedings have become abandoned or inoperative or incapable of being performed In international trade and commerce it is critical that the courts respect and enforce arbitration agreements where they exist in accordance with in particular the New York Convention and legislation designed to give effect to it such as the International Arbitration Act 1974 Cth This is because in international trade and commerce the parties generally will not wish to be subject to serendipity of where a ship may be arrested an action begun or damage occur to determine a forum of any litigation between them or the substantive law to be applied to their dispute The parties will be conscious that an accident or fortuity may occur at any point in a voyage or flight and very different legal results may flow depending on which law and which forum determine their dispute It is for this reason that arbitration clauses such as cl 45b invoking arbitration in London under English law have been a popular recourse for parties in international trade for over a century Nowadays other centres of commercial arbitration including Australia are recognized as providing sound and fair fora and laws for the resolution of disputes in international trade or commerce However the Court should be astute to uphold and enforce agreements such as those in cl 45b rather than to display a form of judicial prejudice or xenophobia against the parties chosen method or place of dispute resolution Refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate in international transactions is capable of undermining the reasonable but significant expectations of the international commercial community and the confidence which it and indeed local business people place in the readiness of courts to hold people to their bargains see eg Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v MV Sky Reefer 515 US 528 at 538 1995 Mitsubishi Motors Corp

which their disputes will be resolved by use of an arbitration agreement such as in cl 45b so they may also choose to give up their rights to use that method or they may so conduct themselves that the choice will be attributed to them by the doctrine of election When Comandate Marine chose to begin its in rem proceedings in the form which it utilized it brought about the consequence that it was taken to have elected not to pursue its arbitration proceedings It may have chosen another method to seek security by framing the relief it sought in its writ in a different way but it did not do so The English authorities on which Comandate Marine relied and to which Sheppard J referred did not consider the question of whether the party seeking security had made an election For that reason I think those authorities are distinguishable Because Comandate Marine elected to litigate the dispute and Pan has too the arbitration agreement in cl 45b has been in substance abandoned or for the purposes of s 75 of the International Arbitration Act 1974 Cth rendered inoperative or incapable of being performed  WAS THERE AN AGREEMENT IN WRITING   Pan argues that Art II r 2 of the New York Convention requires there to be either an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement which is either signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams Pan says that where the contract was formed as it argues the charter party was in this case either by acts or conduct Art II r 2 is not satisfied Pan says that each of the provision of the bank guarantee or the delivery of the vessel was an act or amounted to conduct which brought the contract into existence In support of the argument it relies on decision of the Supreme Court of Italy in Robobar Limited v Finncold SaS 1995 Year Book Comm Arbn XX 739 at 740 The Court held that where a purchase confirmation had been sent by the party seeking to rely on the arbitration clause to which the other party had not responded there was no doubt that none of the formalities in Art II in the New York Convention had been met because the clause was only contained in the confirmation to which the other party had not agreed by letter or telegram Pan also relied on a decision of the Court of Appeal of the Federal Republic of Germany in a case between a Dutch seller and a German buyer 1997 Year Book Comm Arbn Vol II 237 at 238 The Court of Appeal held that a declaration in writing of both sides to the contract was required A one sided confirmation did not suffice and the lack of declaration in writing by the other party could not be cured by that partys appearance in the arbitration In this matter however the critical telex of 20 April 2006 commenced by being in form a confirmation but ended with a request being made to both parties to confirm that the above recap was in line with the negotiations agreed so far The next relevant correspondence was the telex later that day noting that the bank guarantee had been received and indicating when delivery would occur I think this does fall within the positions contemplated by the Supreme Court of Italy and the German Court of Appeal as being ones in which the contract was not formed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams And In Zambia Steel  Building Supplies Ltd v James Clark  Eaton Ltd 1986 2 Lloyds Rep 225 at 234 Ralph Gibson LJ said   It is clear to me that the New York Convention by Art II par 2 did not impose upon the contracting state an obligation to recognise an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration unless it is signed by the parties or unless the agreement is contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams in the sense that the assent to be bound by both parties is given in writing by such document    The Manitoba Court of Appeal noted in Proctor v Schellenberg 2003 2 WWR 621 at 628 18 that Art IV r 1b of the New York Convention requires a party seeking to obtain recognition and enforcement of an award to provide the original agreement referred to in article II or a duly certified copy thereof They said that  there had to be a record to evidence the agreement of the parties to resolve the dispute by arbitral process in concluding that facsimile transmissions were sufficient to be or form part of an agreement in writing In AJ van den Bergs The New York Arbitration Convention of 1958 1981 at 196198 206 277 the learned author notes that Art II r 2 excludes oral or tacit acceptance and concluded at 197 227 that as at 1981 there had been only one  exception to the unanimous judicial affirmation that tacit acceptance does not comply with Art II r 2 that being a decision of the Court of First Instance of Rotterdam The learned author said that this decision was not in conformity with either the text of Art II r 2 or the intent of its drafters and noted that the decision had been rightly criticised Significantly he referred to the history of Art II r 2 which confirmed that the drafters of the New York Convention wished to exclude from its scope oral or tacit acceptance of a written proposal to arbitrate In his article Is the need for writing as expressed in the New York Convention and the Model Law out of step with commercial practice   1996 International Arbitration vol 12 no 1 p 27 at 32 Neil Kaplan QC affirmed Prof van den Bergs interpretation Mr Kaplan referred to discussions that he had had with Prof Pieter Sanders the Dutch delegate in the drafting of the Convention who had given him the actual minutes of the delegates consideration of Prof Sanders

Limited v Goldroyce Garment Limited 1994 2 HKC 526 HCMP000 9081994 that there was no basis for arguing that an arbitration agreement could be established by a course of dealing or the conduct of the parties under Art VII of the Model Law see Schedule 2 to the International Arbitration Act 1974 Cth Kaplan J said that he had looked at the UNCITRAL reports in relation to Art VII and was quite satisfied that it could not be complied with unless there was a record in which the defendant in writing assented to the agreement to arbitrate see at 12 It has been recognized that a national courts in the interest of uniformity should construe rules formulated by an international convention especially rules formulated for the purpose of governing international transactions such as the hire of vessels or the carriage of goods in a normal manner appropriate for the interpretation of an international convention unconstrained by technical rules of English or domestic law or by English or domestic legal precedent but on broad principles of general acceptation Shipping Corporation of India Ltd v Gamlen Chemical Co Australasia Pty Ltd 1980 HCA 51  1980 147 CLR 142 at 159 per Mason and

537 1995 per Kennedy J Renquist CJ Scalia Souter Thomas and Ginsberg JJ agreeing Mason and Wilson JJ went on to say 147 CLR at 159   It is important that we should adhere to this approach when we are interpreting rules which have been formulated for the purpose of regulating the rights and liabilities of parties to international mercantile transactions where great store is set upon certainty and uniformity of application see too Great China Metal Industries Ltd v Malayasian International Shipping Corporation Berhad 1998 HCA 65  1988 196 CLR 161 at 186 71 per McHugh J   It is also important in construing international conventions that the views taken by courts particularly the Supreme Courts of nations are kept in mind so that there can be consistency in interpretation And I am conscious that in s 31 of the International Arbitration Act 1974 Cth the definition of arbitration agreement is that it is an agreement of the kind referred to in Art II r 2 As a matter of construction under Australian law I would have no hesitation in concluding that the definition was inclusive one However I think that the drafting of the definition in Art II r 2 invokes a concept of certainty that the arbitration clause or arbitration agreement is itself signed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams The precontractual exchanges of telexes and emails cannot themselves convert into separate or freestanding agreements in the present case unless and until the vessel was actually agreed to be fixed It was only upon the agreement to fix the vessel that it could be said to be under charter And as Capt Piperakis said he had imposed an absolute condition that a bank guarantee be provided The owners were not prepared to deliver the vessel on the evidence before me unless and until the bank guarantee had been received and it was at that point that they agreed that they were contractually bound That agreement which thus brought cl 45b into existence as an agreement to arbitrate was manifested by Comandate Marines conduct either in accepting the bank guarantee or later delivering the vessel At common law a recap telex can be found to contain a charter party including an arbitration clause which is incorporated by reference to an earlier telex or other communication even though both parties have not executed it The Epsilon Rosa 2003 2 Lloyds Rep 509 at 514 21 per Tuckey LJ May and Brooke LJJ agreeing But as Tuckey LJ pointed out 2003 2 Lloyds Rep at 515 29 one cannot generalize in these cases The act of acceptance which formed the contract was the provision of the bank guarantee And it is common ground that a formal charter party incorporating all of the agreed terms was to be prepared later by Prime on behalf of Comandate Marine Both parties were under a duty to cooperate to bring about the final form of their agreement in writing  Secured Income Real Estate Australia Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Limited 1979 HCA 51  1979 144 CLR 596 at 607 per Mason J applying Butt v MDonald 1896 7 QLJ 68 at 7071 per Griffith CJ No doubt cl 45b was part of the agreement between Pan and Comandate Marine But that does not of itself comply with Art II r 2 Rather the critical part of the conduct by which the contract was formed was the provision by a third party of the bank guarantee which brought the contract into existence So the contract being or including the arbitration agreement was not made by being signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of telexes or emails The contract included the conduct of the provision of the bank guarantee which fell outside the scope of Art II r 2 And because there is no evidence of any further written communication relied on as amounting to a document capable of being part of an exchange of letters or telegrams including telexes or emails then this series of communications does not satisfy the requirements of Art II r 2 A contract can be made by conduct evidencing a manifestation of assent to an offer Empirnall Holdings Pty Limited v Machon Paull Partners Pty Limited 1988 14 NSWLR 523 at 534535 per McHugh JA Samuels JA agreeing at 531 Accordingly I am of opinion that the telex from Prime to Mr Colaco headed FINAL RECAP was an offer by Comandate Marine to charter the vessel on the terms there set out and incorporated by reference which was capable of acceptance only by the provision of the bank guarantee For the reasons I have given based on the fairly settled interpretation of Art II r 2 that tacit acceptance is insufficient on the evidence I find that at the present time there is no agreement in writing for the purposes of Art II r 2 of the New York Convention  COMANDATE MARINES ALTERNATIVE CLAIM FOR STAY UNDER S 53 OF THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION ACT 1984 NSW   Comandate Marine argued that if an agreement in writing for the purposes of s 72 of the International Arbitration Act 1974 Cth were not found I should grant a stay pursuant to s 53 of the Commercial Arbitration Act 1984 NSW The Commercial Arbitration Act 1984 NSW provides that an arbitration agreement  means an agreement in writing to refer present or future disputes to arbitration see s 41 By s 531 the Court may stay the proceedings if it is satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration in accordance with the agreement and that the applicant was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration Having regard to the fact that Comandate Marine commenced its proceedings in rem as I have found without seeking to enforce any claim to arbitrate in those proceedings I am of opinion that the evidence establishes that Comandate Marine was not then ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration However its application for stay is made in Pans proceedings At the time when Pans proceedings were commenced Comandate Marine was pursuing the arbitration proceedings and still seeks to do so now I do not think that makes the commencement of the proceedings in rem irrelevant By s 532  the leave of the Court is required in the proceedings which have been commenced where the applicant for stay has delivered pleadings or taken any other steps in the proceedings other than the entry of an appearance Although Comandate Marines proceedings in rem were in separate proceedings they form as I have held part of the same matter for the purposes of ss 75 and 76 of the Constitution  and I am not minded to exercise any discretion in favour of Comandate Marine having regard to its conduct in taking the in rem proceedings in the circumstances which I have found  SCOPE OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE   Comandate Marine argued that the claims brought under ss 51A  52 and 55A of the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth and seeking relief under ss 82 and 87  including relief setting aside ab initio the charter party and preventing Comandate Marine from enforcing against the plaintiff any arbitral award were colourable It was not put that the claims were an abuse of the process of the Court Rather it was put in oral argument that there had been a misuse of s 12 of the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth because the very complaints the subject of the claims under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth were in essence the same as the breaches of contract relied on by Pan Comandate Marine in written submissions asserted that the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth claims had been made for the improper purpose of fabricating jurisdiction I do not think this argument has any substance Part V of the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth in which s 52 is found sets out a statutory norm of conduct to which corporations must conform in trade or commerce The task of the Court is to apply such norms where they arise in litigation even where the outcome is not materially different to applying the common law of negligence as in Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree 2005 HCA 69  2005 80 ALJR 183 at 191 29 per Gleeson CJ or of passing off as in Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd 2000 HCA 12  2000 202 CLR 45 at 83 97  In the latter case the whole court approved what Mason J had said in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd 1982 HCA 44  1982 149 CLR 191 at 205 see 202 CLR at 83 97 in the following terms   Likewise the operation of s 52 is not restricted by the common law principles relating to passingoff If as I consider the section provides the public with wider protection from deception than the common law it does not follow that there is a conflict between the section and the common law The statute provides an additional remedy  emphasis added   I am of opinion that the statutory remedy relied on by Pan is additional to whatever contractual remedies may be available to it and that there is no basis for the attribution to Pan of any improper purpose to fabricate jurisdiction The Parliament of the Commonwealth has enacted the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth under the trade and commerce power in s 51i of the Constitution  There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Pan has not properly and regularly invoked the Courts jurisdiction Pans pleading raises an issue of substance as to whether or not Comandate Marine engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct I am satisfied that this is truly part of the one controversy which the Court has been asked to quell cf DOrta Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid 2005 HCA 12  2005 79 ALJR 755 at 761 32  The only arguable limitation in the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth which might be seen as restricting the jurisdiction or powers any court invested with jurisdiction under that Act is to be found in s 13 But on examination s 13 does not affect the jurisdiction which a court including this Court has from sources other than the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth itself Rather s 13 provides that the Act does not confer on or invest jurisdiction on or in a court in a matter which is not of a kind mentioned in ss 76ii or iii of the Constitution  In ascertaining the scope of jurisdiction which the Federal Court may exercise s 13 thus provides some guidance It contemplates that matters of a kind mentioned in ss 76ii and iii of the Constitution can be within the jurisdiction of the Court Section 76iii of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction is a clear source of power to enact the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth itself and define maritime claims as well as associated matters of Admiralty and marine jurisdiction in ss 4 and 12  And s 76ii provides that the judicial power of the Commonwealth is invoked in any matter arising under any laws made by the Parliament The purpose of s 13 is to limit in the construction of the Act the conferral of jurisdiction by the Act to matters within the power of the Parliament and the judicial power of the Commonwealth It is not to limit the other powers of a court on or in which the Act confers or invests jurisdiction Clearly enough s 86 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth is a law made by the Parliament which confers jurisdiction on this Court independently of the jurisdiction conferred on it by the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth It is quite inappropriate to read provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court by making implications or imposing limitations which are not found in the express words Owners of Shin Kobe Maru v Empire Shipping Co Inc 1994 HCA 54  1994 181 CLR 404 at 421 see too Mansfield v Director of Public Prosecutions for

jurisdiction conferred by the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth by s 31 But s 311 provides that the liability on a judgment of a relevant person defined by s 31 as a person who would be liable were the proceedings in personam brought against that person who has entered an appearance in a proceeding on a maritime claim commenced as an action in rem against a ship or property is not limited to the value of the ship or other property The section confirms the amplitude of the jurisdiction rather than restricts it Next Comandate Marine argued that a relevant person who appears in proceedings commenced by a writ in rem cannot be sued in proceedings in personam in this Court in respect of matters outside the relief claimed in the writ in rem on a cause of action other than a maritime claim within the meaning of s 4 of the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth or on associated matters of admiralty and marine jurisdiction within the meaning of s 12 of that Act Here part of the matter within the meaning of ss 76ii and iii of the Constitution  is the controversy between the parties under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth which Pan has pleaded The judicial power of the Commonwealth is exercised in resolving such matters Here the controversy involves claims under two Acts of the Parliament each of which specifically and independently one of the other confers jurisdiction on this Court Accordingly I am of opinion that this Court does have jurisdiction to hear and determine such an in personam proceeding as this That is not to say however that the ship or property the subject of the writ in rem will be available necessarily to answer any judgment for any in personam claim against a relevant person such as one under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth which is neither a maritime claim or an associated matter within the meaning of ss 4 or 12  I am of opinion that the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth cannot be construed as in any way limiting the jurisdiction of this Court to hear and determine any matter within its jurisdiction Rather appositely to the present proceedings there may be a question at the trial as to the availability of the bank guarantee which Comandate Marine provided as security in lieu of the ship Comandate to satisfy a claim made by Pan which is not within ss 4 or 12 of the Act Pans claim in personam for relief under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth is not invalid and its proceedings in personam are not invalidated by that claim s 51 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 Cth The Court at the final hearing can address any injustice which might arise if Comandate Marine wishes then to agitate such matters including whether the security provided should be available to satisfy any claim under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth The Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth provides Pan with remedies different to any remedy that could be awarded in pursuance of its contract claims Indeed one of the remedies it seeks is the avoidance of the contract not pursuant to contractual principles but by force of an order under s 87 of the Act Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Limited 2004 HCA 3  2004 216 CLR 388 at 409 52  And the High Court has emphasized that the remedies under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth are designed to give effect in cases of contravention of s 52  to the prescribed standards of conduct which are embodied in that section where activities occur in trade or commerce Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited 2000 HCA 12  2000 202 CLR 45 at 83 97  Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree 2005 HCA 69  2005 80 ALJR 183

06_1112.xml,c4,cited,Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority [2006] HCA 27,As noted above Comandate Marines proceedings in rem contained no such request And Art 81 of the Model Law relevantly requires a court in which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement to refer the parties to arbitration if a party so requests no later than when submitting its first statement on the substance of the dispute 59 Russell on Arbitration 22 nd ed at 610 A5018 refers to Art 81 having the same effect as English law ie the party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement must apply to the court without delay for a stay of the proceedings op cit at 296 7005 The position is similar under s 532 of the Commercial Arbitration Act 1984 NSW which applies here by force of s 79 of the Judiciary Act 1903 Cth Comandate Marine did not apply to have its proceedings referred to arbitration when they were before this Court or the High Court I am of opinion that Comandate Marines conduct in bringing its proceedings in rem was incompatible with the arbitration agreement and that Art 81 and Art 9 of the Model Law do not avail it Comandate Marine is in a similar position to that of the landlord in the example given by Parker J in Matthews v Smallwood 1910 1 Ch at 786787 By pleading the writ in the way which it did Comandate Marine exercised a right of action given by the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth to litigate the breach of the charter party as a general maritime claim under s 43f of the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth in this Court I am of opinion that in choosing to claim only that relief when it invoked the jurisdiction of the Court Comandate Marine could not do that without prejudice to any right it might otherwise have had to seek security for the arbitration under s 29 at a later stage It made no such claim in the writ and it procured the arrest of the vessel for the purposes of the particular relief which it claimed in the writ The way in which Comandate Marine framed its claim in the writ nailed its colours to the mast as much as the warrant for arrest later was nailed notionally or actually to the mast of the Boomerang I  Having invoked the jurisdiction of the Court to procure the arrest of the vessel in order to pursue the only claims it pleaded it is not open to Comandate Marine now to say that it did so without prejudice to any right later to apply for security under s 29 of the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth In its report Civil Admiralty Jurisdiction Report No 33 1986 Law Reform Commission Australia the Commission recommended the introduction of what has become s 29 so as to enable the Admiralty jurisdiction to be used to obtain and retain security even though the merits of the dispute are to be determined elsewhere if the subject matter of the dispute lies within Admiralty jurisdiction The Commission noted that such a solution would do most to ensure that the award of the tribunal that decides upon the merits is satisfied and hence that a just result would be obtained It noted that the law had a strong interest in compliance with arbitral awards duly made and in achieving cooperation between courts and arbitrators to this end However the Commission desired in the solution it proposed that the Court should retain a discretion to stay or to exercise jurisdiction to decide the merits ALRC 33 189 That discretion was to arise in the Court being able to take into account all relevant circumstances although the Commission noted that as at 1986 English and South African courts required the plaintiff to demonstrate why the assistance of a court was required in retaining security although there were shades of difference between the readiness of the respective jurisdictions to assist in respect of claims otherwise unconnected with the forum The Tuyuti 1984 QB 838 at 851 Katagum Wholesale Commodities v The MV Paz 1984 3 SAf LR 261 at 268 270 Natal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa Neither party argued that the analysis of the present question should be approached on the basis that there had been a contract of abandonment such as in Paal Wilson  Co AS v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal 1983 1 AC 854 at 915916 There Lord Diplock considered that abandonment of a contract which was still executory involved the formation of a contract of abandonment in which each party promised to release the other from performance of all further obligations including the obligation to pay damages for past breaches arising under the executory and now abandoned contract Lord Brandon of Oakbrook who gave the leading speech see 1983 1 AC 900C per Lord Diplock said that the question of whether a contract has been abandoned or not is one of fact 1983 1 AC at 913F He continued 1983 1 AC at 914AC   The concept of the implied abandonment of a contract as a result of the conduct of the parties to it is well established in law  see Chitty on Contracts  23 rd ed 1968 vol 1 p 577 para 1231 and cases there cited Where A seeks to prove that he and B have abandoned a contract in this way there are two ways in which A can put his case The first way is by showing that the conduct of each party as evinced to the other party and acted on by him leads necessarily to the inference of an implied agreement between them to abandon the contract The second method is by showing that the conduct of B as evinced towards A has been such as to lead A reasonably to believe that B has abandoned the contract even though it has not in fact been Bs intention to do so and that A has significantly altered his position in reliance on that belief The first method involves actual abandonment by both A and B The second method involves the creation by B of a situation in which he is estopped from asserting as against A that he B has not abandoned the contract  Pearl Mill Co v Ivy Tannery Co Ltd 1919 1 KB 78    This contractual analysis is inapposite here but their Lordships approach shows that notwithstanding that arbitration proceedings have been regularly commenced and that both parties are bound to their pursuit the conduct of one party or both parties can bring about the legal consequence that the parties obligations to arbitrate in the arbitration proceedings have become abandoned or inoperative or incapable of being performed In international trade and commerce it is critical that the courts respect and enforce arbitration agreements where they exist in accordance with in particular the New York Convention and legislation designed to give effect to it such as the International Arbitration Act 1974 Cth This is because in international trade and commerce the parties generally will not wish to be subject to serendipity of where a ship may be arrested an action begun or damage occur to determine a forum of any litigation between them or the substantive law to be applied to their dispute The parties will be conscious that an accident or fortuity may occur at any point in a voyage or flight and very different legal results may flow depending on which law and which forum determine their dispute It is for this reason that arbitration clauses such as cl 45b invoking arbitration in London under English law have been a popular recourse for parties in international trade for over a century Nowadays other centres of commercial arbitration including Australia are recognized as providing sound and fair fora and laws for the resolution of disputes in international trade or commerce However the Court should be astute to uphold and enforce agreements such as those in cl 45b rather than to display a form of judicial prejudice or xenophobia against the parties chosen method or place of dispute resolution Refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate in international transactions is capable of undermining the reasonable but significant expectations of the international commercial community and the confidence which it and indeed local business people place in the readiness of courts to hold people to their bargains see eg Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v MV Sky Reefer 515 US 528 at 538 1995 Mitsubishi Motors Corp

which their disputes will be resolved by use of an arbitration agreement such as in cl 45b so they may also choose to give up their rights to use that method or they may so conduct themselves that the choice will be attributed to them by the doctrine of election When Comandate Marine chose to begin its in rem proceedings in the form which it utilized it brought about the consequence that it was taken to have elected not to pursue its arbitration proceedings It may have chosen another method to seek security by framing the relief it sought in its writ in a different way but it did not do so The English authorities on which Comandate Marine relied and to which Sheppard J referred did not consider the question of whether the party seeking security had made an election For that reason I think those authorities are distinguishable Because Comandate Marine elected to litigate the dispute and Pan has too the arbitration agreement in cl 45b has been in substance abandoned or for the purposes of s 75 of the International Arbitration Act 1974 Cth rendered inoperative or incapable of being performed  WAS THERE AN AGREEMENT IN WRITING   Pan argues that Art II r 2 of the New York Convention requires there to be either an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement which is either signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams Pan says that where the contract was formed as it argues the charter party was in this case either by acts or conduct Art II r 2 is not satisfied Pan says that each of the provision of the bank guarantee or the delivery of the vessel was an act or amounted to conduct which brought the contract into existence In support of the argument it relies on decision of the Supreme Court of Italy in Robobar Limited v Finncold SaS 1995 Year Book Comm Arbn XX 739 at 740 The Court held that where a purchase confirmation had been sent by the party seeking to rely on the arbitration clause to which the other party had not responded there was no doubt that none of the formalities in Art II in the New York Convention had been met because the clause was only contained in the confirmation to which the other party had not agreed by letter or telegram Pan also relied on a decision of the Court of Appeal of the Federal Republic of Germany in a case between a Dutch seller and a German buyer 1997 Year Book Comm Arbn Vol II 237 at 238 The Court of Appeal held that a declaration in writing of both sides to the contract was required A one sided confirmation did not suffice and the lack of declaration in writing by the other party could not be cured by that partys appearance in the arbitration In this matter however the critical telex of 20 April 2006 commenced by being in form a confirmation but ended with a request being made to both parties to confirm that the above recap was in line with the negotiations agreed so far The next relevant correspondence was the telex later that day noting that the bank guarantee had been received and indicating when delivery would occur I think this does fall within the positions contemplated by the Supreme Court of Italy and the German Court of Appeal as being ones in which the contract was not formed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams And In Zambia Steel  Building Supplies Ltd v James Clark  Eaton Ltd 1986 2 Lloyds Rep 225 at 234 Ralph Gibson LJ said   It is clear to me that the New York Convention by Art II par 2 did not impose upon the contracting state an obligation to recognise an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration unless it is signed by the parties or unless the agreement is contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams in the sense that the assent to be bound by both parties is given in writing by such document    The Manitoba Court of Appeal noted in Proctor v Schellenberg 2003 2 WWR 621 at 628 18 that Art IV r 1b of the New York Convention requires a party seeking to obtain recognition and enforcement of an award to provide the original agreement referred to in article II or a duly certified copy thereof They said that  there had to be a record to evidence the agreement of the parties to resolve the dispute by arbitral process in concluding that facsimile transmissions were sufficient to be or form part of an agreement in writing In AJ van den Bergs The New York Arbitration Convention of 1958 1981 at 196198 206 277 the learned author notes that Art II r 2 excludes oral or tacit acceptance and concluded at 197 227 that as at 1981 there had been only one  exception to the unanimous judicial affirmation that tacit acceptance does not comply with Art II r 2 that being a decision of the Court of First Instance of Rotterdam The learned author said that this decision was not in conformity with either the text of Art II r 2 or the intent of its drafters and noted that the decision had been rightly criticised Significantly he referred to the history of Art II r 2 which confirmed that the drafters of the New York Convention wished to exclude from its scope oral or tacit acceptance of a written proposal to arbitrate In his article Is the need for writing as expressed in the New York Convention and the Model Law out of step with commercial practice   1996 International Arbitration vol 12 no 1 p 27 at 32 Neil Kaplan QC affirmed Prof van den Bergs interpretation Mr Kaplan referred

Limited v Goldroyce Garment Limited 1994 2 HKC 526 HCMP000 9081994 that there was no basis for arguing that an arbitration agreement could be established by a course of dealing or the conduct of the parties under Art VII of the Model Law see Schedule 2 to the International Arbitration Act 1974 Cth Kaplan J said that he had looked at the UNCITRAL reports in relation to Art VII and was quite satisfied that it could not be complied with unless there was a record in which the defendant in writing assented to the agreement to arbitrate see at 12 It has been recognized that a national courts in the interest of uniformity should construe rules formulated by an international convention especially rules formulated for the purpose of governing international transactions such as the hire of vessels or the carriage of goods in a normal manner appropriate for the interpretation of an international convention unconstrained by technical rules of English or domestic law or by English or domestic legal precedent but on broad principles of general acceptation Shipping Corporation of India Ltd v Gamlen Chemical Co Australasia Pty Ltd 1980 HCA 51  1980 147 CLR 142 at 159 per Mason and

537 1995 per Kennedy J Renquist CJ Scalia Souter Thomas and Ginsberg JJ agreeing Mason and Wilson JJ went on to say 147 CLR at 159   It is important that we should adhere to this approach when we are interpreting rules which have been formulated for the purpose of regulating the rights and liabilities of parties to international mercantile transactions where great store is set upon certainty and uniformity of application see too Great China Metal Industries Ltd v Malayasian International Shipping Corporation Berhad 1998 HCA 65  1988 196 CLR 161 at 186 71 per McHugh J   It is also important in construing international conventions that the views taken by courts particularly the Supreme Courts of nations are kept in mind so that there can be consistency in interpretation And I am conscious that in s 31 of the International Arbitration Act 1974 Cth the definition of arbitration agreement is that it is an agreement of the kind referred to in Art II r 2 As a matter of construction under Australian law I would have no hesitation in concluding that the definition was inclusive one However I think that the drafting of the definition in Art II r 2 invokes a concept of certainty that the arbitration clause or arbitration agreement is itself signed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams The precontractual exchanges of telexes and emails cannot themselves convert into separate or freestanding agreements in the present case unless and until the vessel was actually agreed to be fixed It was only upon the agreement to fix the vessel that it could be said to be under charter And as Capt Piperakis said he had imposed an absolute condition that a bank guarantee be provided The owners were not prepared to deliver the vessel on the evidence before me unless and until the bank guarantee had been received and it was at that point that they agreed that they were contractually bound That agreement which thus brought cl 45b into existence as an agreement to arbitrate was manifested by Comandate Marines conduct either in accepting the bank guarantee or later delivering the vessel At common law a recap telex can be found to contain a charter party including an arbitration clause which is incorporated by reference to an earlier telex or other communication even though both parties have not executed it The Epsilon Rosa 2003 2 Lloyds Rep 509 at 514 21 per Tuckey LJ May and Brooke LJJ agreeing But as Tuckey LJ pointed out 2003 2 Lloyds Rep at 515 29 one cannot generalize in these cases The act of acceptance which formed the contract was the provision of the bank guarantee And it is common ground that a formal charter party incorporating all of the agreed terms was to be prepared later by Prime on behalf of Comandate Marine Both parties were under a duty to cooperate to bring about the final form of their agreement in writing  Secured Income Real Estate Australia Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Limited 1979 HCA 51  1979 144 CLR 596 at 607 per Mason J applying Butt v MDonald 1896 7 QLJ 68 at 7071 per Griffith CJ No doubt cl 45b was part of the agreement between Pan and Comandate Marine But that does not of itself comply with Art II r 2 Rather the critical part of the conduct by which the contract was formed was the provision by a third party of the bank guarantee which brought the contract into existence So the contract being or including the arbitration agreement was not made by being signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of telexes or emails The contract included the conduct of the provision of the bank guarantee which fell outside the scope of Art II r 2 And because there is no evidence of any further written communication relied on as amounting to a document capable of being part of an exchange of letters or telegrams including telexes or emails then this series of communications does not satisfy the requirements of Art II r 2 A contract can be made by conduct evidencing a manifestation of assent to an offer Empirnall Holdings Pty Limited v Machon Paull Partners Pty Limited 1988 14 NSWLR 523 at 534535 per McHugh JA Samuels JA agreeing at 531 Accordingly I am of opinion that the telex from Prime to Mr Colaco headed FINAL RECAP was an offer by Comandate Marine to charter the vessel on the terms there set out and incorporated by reference which was capable of acceptance only by the provision of the bank guarantee For the reasons I have given based on the fairly settled interpretation of Art II r 2 that tacit acceptance is insufficient on the evidence I find that at the present time there is no agreement in writing for the purposes of Art II r 2 of the New York Convention  COMANDATE MARINES ALTERNATIVE CLAIM FOR STAY UNDER S 53 OF THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION ACT 1984 NSW   Comandate Marine argued that if an agreement in writing for the purposes of s 72 of the International Arbitration Act 1974 Cth were not found I should grant a stay pursuant to s 53 of the Commercial Arbitration Act 1984 NSW The Commercial Arbitration Act 1984 NSW provides that an arbitration agreement  means an agreement in writing to refer present or future disputes to arbitration see s 41 By s 531 the Court may stay the proceedings if it is satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration in accordance with the agreement and that the applicant was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration Having regard to the fact that Comandate Marine commenced its proceedings in rem as I have found without seeking to enforce any claim to arbitrate in those proceedings I am of opinion that the evidence establishes that Comandate Marine was not then ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration However its application for stay is made in Pans proceedings At the time when Pans proceedings were commenced Comandate Marine was pursuing the arbitration proceedings and still seeks to do so now I do not think that makes the commencement of the proceedings in rem irrelevant By s 532  the leave of the Court is required in the proceedings which have been commenced where the applicant for stay has delivered pleadings or taken any other steps in the proceedings other than the entry of an appearance Although Comandate Marines proceedings in rem were in separate proceedings they form as I have held part of the same matter for the purposes of ss 75 and 76 of the Constitution  and I am not minded to exercise any discretion in favour of Comandate Marine having regard to its conduct in taking the in rem proceedings in the circumstances which I have found  SCOPE OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE   Comandate Marine argued that the claims brought under ss 51A  52 and 55A of the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth and seeking relief under ss 82 and 87  including relief setting aside ab initio the charter party and preventing Comandate Marine from enforcing against the plaintiff any arbitral award were colourable It was not put that the claims were an abuse of the process of the Court Rather it was put in oral argument that there had been a misuse of s 12 of the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth because the very complaints the subject of the claims under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth were in essence the same as the breaches of contract relied on by Pan Comandate Marine in written submissions asserted that the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth claims had been made for the improper purpose of fabricating jurisdiction I do not think this argument has any substance Part V of the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth in which s 52 is found sets out a statutory norm of conduct to which corporations must conform in trade or commerce The task of the Court is to apply such norms where they arise in litigation even where the outcome is not materially different to applying the common law of negligence as in Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree 2005 HCA 69  2005 80 ALJR 183 at 191 29 per Gleeson CJ or of passing off as in Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd 2000 HCA 12  2000 202 CLR 45 at 83 97  In the latter case the whole court approved what Mason J had said in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd 1982 HCA 44  1982 149 CLR 191 at 205 see 202 CLR at 83 97 in the following terms   Likewise the operation of s 52 is not restricted by the common law principles relating to passingoff If as I consider the section provides the public with wider protection from deception than the common law it does not follow that there is a conflict between the section and the common law The statute provides an additional remedy  emphasis added   I am of opinion that the statutory remedy relied on by Pan is additional to whatever contractual remedies may be available to it and that there is no basis for the attribution to Pan of any improper purpose to fabricate jurisdiction The Parliament of the Commonwealth has enacted the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth under the trade and commerce power in s 51i of the Constitution  There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Pan has not properly and regularly invoked the Courts jurisdiction Pans pleading raises an issue of substance as to whether or not Comandate Marine engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct I am satisfied that this is truly part of the one controversy which the Court has been asked to quell cf DOrta Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid 2005 HCA 12  2005 79 ALJR 755 at 761 32  The only arguable limitation in the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth which might be seen as restricting the jurisdiction or powers any court invested with jurisdiction under that Act is to be found in s 13 But on examination s 13 does not affect the jurisdiction which a court including this Court has from sources other than the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth itself Rather s 13 provides that the Act does not confer on or invest jurisdiction on or in a court in a matter which is not of a kind mentioned in ss 76ii or iii of the Constitution  In ascertaining the scope of jurisdiction which the Federal Court may exercise s 13 thus provides some guidance It contemplates that matters of a kind mentioned in ss 76ii and iii of the Constitution can be within the jurisdiction of the Court Section 76iii of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction is a clear source of power to enact the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth itself and define maritime claims as well as associated matters of Admiralty and marine jurisdiction in ss 4 and 12  And s 76ii provides that the judicial power of the Commonwealth is invoked in any matter arising under any laws made by the Parliament The purpose of s 13 is to limit in the construction of the Act the conferral of jurisdiction by the Act to matters within the power of the Parliament and the judicial power of the Commonwealth It is not to limit the other powers of a court on or in which the Act confers or invests jurisdiction Clearly enough s 86 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth is a law made by the Parliament which confers jurisdiction on this Court independently of the jurisdiction conferred on it by the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth It is quite inappropriate to read provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court by making implications or imposing limitations which are not found in the express words Owners of Shin Kobe Maru v Empire Shipping Co Inc 1994 HCA 54  1994 181 CLR 404 at 421 see too Mansfield v Director of Public Prosecutions for Western Australia 2006 HCA 38 at 7  10 per Gleeson CJ Gummow Kirby Hayne and Crennan JJ Once the jurisdiction of this Court has been invoked the Court should exercise it  Re Wakim Ex parte McNally 1999 HCA 27  1999 198 CLR 511 at 588 149  even if it be to protect itself and its processes against their abuse cf Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority 2006 HCA 27 315 per Gleeson CJ Gummow Hayne and Crennan JJ see too Elbe Shipping SA v The Ship Global Peace 2006 FCA 954 at 138 per Allsop J see too at 6276 Comandate Marine also argued that a limitation was imposed on courts exercising jurisdiction conferred by the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth by s 31 But s 311 provides that the liability on a judgment of a relevant person defined by s 31 as a person who would be liable were the proceedings in personam brought against that person who has entered an appearance in a proceeding on a maritime claim commenced as an action in rem against a ship or property is not limited to the value of the ship or other property The section confirms the amplitude of the jurisdiction rather than restricts it Next Comandate Marine argued that a relevant person who appears in proceedings commenced by a writ in rem cannot be sued in proceedings in personam in this Court in respect of matters outside the relief claimed in the writ in rem on a cause of action other than a maritime claim within the meaning of s 4 of the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth or on associated matters of admiralty and marine jurisdiction within the meaning of s 12 of that Act Here part of the matter within the meaning of ss 76ii and iii of the Constitution  is the controversy between the parties under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth which Pan has pleaded The judicial power of the Commonwealth is exercised in resolving such matters Here the controversy involves claims under two Acts of the Parliament each of which specifically and independently one of the other confers jurisdiction on this Court Accordingly I am of opinion that this Court does have jurisdiction to hear and determine such an in personam proceeding as this That is not to say however that the ship or property the subject of the writ in rem will be available necessarily to answer any judgment for any in personam claim against a relevant person such as one under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth which is neither a maritime claim or an associated matter within the meaning of ss 4 or 12  I am of opinion that the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth cannot be construed as in any way limiting the jurisdiction of this Court to hear and determine any matter within its jurisdiction Rather appositely to the present proceedings there may be a question at the trial as to the availability of the bank guarantee which Comandate Marine provided as security in lieu of the ship Comandate to satisfy a claim made by Pan which is not within ss 4 or 12 of the Act Pans claim in personam for relief under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth is not invalid and its proceedings in personam are not invalidated by that claim s 51 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 Cth The Court at the final hearing can address any injustice which might arise if Comandate Marine wishes then to agitate such matters including whether the security provided should be available to satisfy any claim under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth The Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth provides Pan with remedies different to any remedy that could be awarded in pursuance of its contract claims Indeed one of the remedies it seeks is the avoidance of the contract not pursuant to contractual principles but by force of an order under s 87 of the Act Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Limited 2004 HCA 3  2004 216 CLR 388 at 409 52  And the High Court has emphasized that the remedies under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth are designed to give effect in cases of contravention of s 52  to the prescribed standards of conduct which are embodied in that section where activities occur in trade or commerce Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited 2000 HCA 12  2000 202 CLR 45 at 83 97  Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree 2005 HCA 69  2005 80 ALJR 183 International trade including the entry into charter parties for vessels is quintessentially within the trade and commerce clause of the Constitution s 51i And par 15 of the amended statement of claim pleads specifically that the relevant conduct occurred in Australia because the communications and representations were received by Mr Colaco in Australia see Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Limited 1990 HCA 55  1990 171 CLR 538 at 568 per Mason CJ Deane Dawson and Gaudron JJ Sydbank Soenderjylland AS v Bannerton Holdings Pty Ltd 1996 68 FCR 539 at 547A548D per Beaumont Drummond and Sundberg JJ Next Comandate Marine argued that I should not follow the decision of the Full Court in The Kiukiang Career  HiFert Pty Limited v Kiukiang Maritime Carriers Inc No 5 1998 90 FCR 1 In that case the relevant clause provided that any dispute arising from this charter would be settled in a London arbitration Obviously it is important to recognize that in every contract the proper construction of

06_1112.xml,c6,followed,Butt v M'Donald (1896) 7 QLJ 68,As noted above Comandate Marines proceedings in rem contained no such request And Art 81 of the Model Law relevantly requires a court in which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement to refer the parties to arbitration if a party so requests no later than when submitting its first statement on the substance of the dispute 59 Russell on Arbitration 22 nd ed at 610 A5018 refers to Art 81 having the same effect as English law ie the party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement must apply to the court without delay for a stay of the proceedings op cit at 296 7005 The position is similar under s 532 of the Commercial Arbitration Act 1984 NSW which applies here by force of s 79 of the Judiciary Act 1903 Cth Comandate Marine did not apply to have its proceedings referred to arbitration when they were before this Court or the High Court I am of opinion that Comandate Marines conduct in bringing its proceedings in rem was incompatible with the arbitration agreement and that Art 81 and Art 9 of the Model Law do not avail it Comandate Marine is in a similar position to that of the landlord in the example given by Parker J in Matthews v Smallwood 1910 1 Ch at 786787 By pleading the writ in the way which it did Comandate Marine exercised a right of action given by the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth to litigate the breach of the charter party as a general maritime claim under s 43f of the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth in this Court I am of opinion that in choosing to claim only that relief when it invoked the jurisdiction of the Court Comandate Marine could not do that without prejudice to any right it might otherwise have had to seek security for the arbitration under s 29 at a later stage It made no such claim in the writ and it procured the arrest of the vessel for the purposes of the particular relief which it claimed in the writ The way in which Comandate Marine framed its claim in the writ nailed its colours to the mast as much as the warrant for arrest later was nailed notionally or actually to the mast of the Boomerang I  Having invoked the jurisdiction of the Court to procure the arrest of the vessel in order to pursue the only claims it pleaded it is not open to Comandate Marine now to say that it did so without prejudice to any right later to apply for security under s 29 of the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth In its report Civil Admiralty Jurisdiction Report No 33 1986 Law Reform Commission Australia the Commission recommended the introduction of what has become s 29 so as to enable the Admiralty jurisdiction to be used to obtain and retain security even though the merits of the dispute are to be determined elsewhere if the subject matter of the dispute lies within Admiralty jurisdiction The Commission noted that such a solution would do most to ensure that the award of the tribunal that decides upon the merits is satisfied and hence that a just result would be obtained It noted that the law had a strong interest in compliance with arbitral awards duly made and in achieving cooperation between courts and arbitrators to this end However the Commission desired in the solution it proposed that the Court should retain a discretion to stay or to exercise jurisdiction to decide the merits ALRC 33 189 That discretion was to arise in the Court being able to take into account all relevant circumstances although the Commission noted that as at 1986 English and South African courts required the plaintiff to demonstrate why the assistance of a court was required in retaining security although there were shades of difference between the readiness of the respective jurisdictions to assist in respect of claims otherwise unconnected with the forum The Tuyuti 1984 QB 838 at 851 Katagum Wholesale Commodities v The MV Paz 1984 3 SAf LR 261 at 268 270 Natal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa Neither party argued that the analysis of the present question should be approached on the basis that there had been a contract of abandonment such as in Paal Wilson  Co AS v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal 1983 1 AC 854 at 915916 There Lord Diplock considered that abandonment of a contract which was still executory involved the formation of a contract of abandonment in which each party promised to release the other from performance of all further obligations including the obligation to pay damages for past breaches arising under the executory and now abandoned contract Lord Brandon of Oakbrook who gave the leading speech see 1983 1 AC 900C per Lord Diplock said that the question of whether a contract has been abandoned or not is one of fact 1983 1 AC at 913F He continued 1983 1 AC at 914AC   The concept of the implied abandonment of a contract as a result of the conduct of the parties to it is well established in law  see Chitty on Contracts  23 rd ed 1968 vol 1 p 577 para 1231 and cases there cited Where A seeks to prove that he and B have abandoned a contract in this way there are two ways in which A can put his case The first way is by showing that the conduct of each party as evinced to the other party and acted on by him leads necessarily to the inference of an implied agreement between them to abandon the contract The second method is by showing that the conduct of B as evinced towards A has been such as to lead A reasonably to believe that B has abandoned the contract even though it has not in fact been Bs intention to do so and that A has significantly altered his position in reliance on that belief The first method involves actual abandonment by both A and B The second method involves the creation by B of a situation in which he is estopped from asserting as against A that he B has not abandoned the contract  Pearl Mill Co v Ivy Tannery Co Ltd 1919 1 KB 78    This contractual analysis is inapposite here but their Lordships approach shows that notwithstanding that arbitration proceedings have been regularly commenced and that both parties are bound to their pursuit the conduct of one party or both parties can bring about the legal consequence that the parties obligations to arbitrate in the arbitration proceedings have become abandoned or inoperative or incapable of being performed In international trade and commerce it is critical that the courts respect and enforce arbitration agreements where they exist in accordance with in particular the New York Convention and legislation designed to give effect to it such as the International Arbitration Act 1974 Cth This is because in international trade and commerce the parties generally will not wish to be subject to serendipity of where a ship may be arrested an action begun or damage occur to determine a forum of any litigation between them or the substantive law to be applied to their dispute The parties will be conscious that an accident or fortuity may occur at any point in a voyage or flight and very different legal results may flow depending on which law and which forum determine their dispute It is for this reason that arbitration clauses such as cl 45b invoking arbitration in London under English law have been a popular recourse for parties in international trade for over a century Nowadays other centres of commercial arbitration including Australia are recognized as providing sound and fair fora and laws for the resolution of disputes in international trade or commerce However the Court should be astute to uphold and enforce agreements such as those in cl 45b rather than to display a form of judicial prejudice or xenophobia against the parties chosen method or place of dispute resolution Refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate in international transactions is capable of undermining the reasonable but significant expectations of the international commercial community and the confidence which it and indeed local business people place in the readiness of courts to hold people to their bargains see eg Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v MV Sky Reefer 515 US 528 at 538 1995 Mitsubishi Motors Corp v Soler ChryslerPlymouth Inc 473 US 614 638 1985 Scherk v AlbertoCulver

1994 113 DLR 4 th  536 at 541542 Federal Court of Appeal But just as parties may choose to invoke arbitration as the method by which their disputes will be resolved by use of an arbitration agreement such as in cl 45b so they may also choose to give up their rights to use that method or they may so conduct themselves that the choice will be attributed to them by the doctrine of election When Comandate Marine chose to begin its in rem proceedings in the form which it utilized it brought about the consequence that it was taken to have elected not to pursue its arbitration proceedings It may have chosen another method to seek security by framing the relief it sought in its writ in a different way but it did not do so The English authorities on which Comandate Marine relied and to which Sheppard J referred did not consider the question of whether the party seeking security had made an election For that reason I think those authorities are distinguishable Because Comandate Marine elected to litigate the dispute and Pan has too the arbitration agreement in cl 45b has been in substance abandoned or for the purposes of s 75 of the International Arbitration Act 1974 Cth rendered inoperative or incapable of being performed  WAS THERE AN AGREEMENT IN WRITING   Pan argues that Art II r 2 of the New York Convention requires there to be either an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement which is either signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams Pan says that where the contract was formed as it argues the charter party was in this case either by acts or conduct Art II r 2 is not satisfied Pan says that each of the provision of the bank guarantee or the delivery of the vessel was an act or amounted to conduct which brought the contract into existence In support of the argument it relies on decision of the Supreme Court of Italy in Robobar Limited v Finncold SaS 1995 Year Book Comm Arbn XX 739 at 740 The Court held that where a purchase confirmation had been sent by the party seeking to rely on the arbitration clause to which the other party had not responded there was no doubt that none of the formalities in Art II in the New York Convention had been met because the clause was only contained in the confirmation to which the other party had not agreed by letter or telegram Pan also relied on a decision of the Court of Appeal of the Federal Republic of Germany in a case between a Dutch seller and a German buyer 1997 Year Book Comm Arbn Vol II 237 at 238 The Court of Appeal held that a declaration in writing of both sides to the contract was required A one sided confirmation did not suffice and the lack of declaration in writing by the other party could not be cured by that partys appearance in the arbitration In this matter however the critical telex of 20 April 2006 commenced by being in form a confirmation but ended with a request being made to both parties to confirm that the above recap was in line with the negotiations agreed so far The next relevant correspondence was the telex later that day noting that the bank guarantee had been received and indicating when delivery would occur I think this does fall within the positions contemplated by the Supreme Court of Italy and the German Court of Appeal as being ones in which the contract was not formed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams And In Zambia Steel  Building Supplies Ltd v James Clark  Eaton Ltd 1986 2 Lloyds Rep 225 at 234 Ralph Gibson LJ said   It is clear to me that the New York Convention by Art II par 2 did not impose upon the contracting state an obligation to recognise an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration unless it is signed by the parties or unless the agreement is contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams in the sense that the assent to be bound by both parties is given in writing by such document    The Manitoba Court of Appeal noted in Proctor v Schellenberg 2003 2 WWR 621 at 628 18 that Art IV r 1b of the New York Convention requires a party seeking to obtain recognition and enforcement of an award to provide the original agreement referred to in article II or a duly certified copy thereof They said that  there had to be a record to evidence the agreement of the parties to resolve the dispute by arbitral process in concluding that facsimile transmissions were sufficient to be or form part of an agreement in writing In AJ van den Bergs The New York Arbitration Convention of 1958 1981 at 196198 206 277 the learned author notes that Art II r 2 excludes oral or tacit acceptance and concluded at 197 227 that as at 1981 there had been only one  exception to the unanimous judicial affirmation that tacit acceptance does not comply with Art II r 2 that being a decision of the Court of First Instance of Rotterdam The learned author said that this decision was not in conformity with either the text of Art II r 2 or the intent of its drafters and noted that the decision had been rightly criticised Significantly he referred to the history of Art II r 2 which confirmed that the drafters of the New York Convention wished to exclude from its scope oral or tacit acceptance of a written proposal to arbitrate In his article Is the need for writing as expressed in the New York Convention and the Model Law out of step with commercial practice   1996 International Arbitration vol 12 no 1 p 27 at 32 Neil Kaplan QC affirmed Prof van den Bergs interpretation Mr Kaplan referred to discussions that he had had with Prof Pieter Sanders the Dutch delegate

van den Berg op cit at 196 Kaplan op cit 3233 Earlier as Kaplan J he had held in the High Court of Hong Kong in H Smal Limited v Goldroyce Garment Limited 1994 2 HKC 526 HCMP000 9081994 that there was no basis for arguing that an arbitration agreement could be established by a course of dealing or the conduct of the parties under Art VII of the Model Law see Schedule 2 to the International Arbitration Act 1974 Cth Kaplan J said that he had looked at the UNCITRAL reports in relation to Art VII and was quite satisfied that it could not be complied with unless there was a record in which the defendant in writing assented to the agreement to arbitrate see at 12 It has been recognized that a national courts in the interest of uniformity should construe rules formulated by an international convention especially rules formulated for the purpose of governing international transactions such as the hire of vessels or the carriage of goods in a normal manner appropriate for the interpretation of an international convention unconstrained by technical rules of English or domestic law or by English or domestic legal precedent but on broad principles of general acceptation

agreeing Mason and Wilson JJ went on to say 147 CLR at 159   It is important that we should adhere to this approach when we are interpreting rules which have been formulated for the purpose of regulating the rights and liabilities of parties to international mercantile transactions where great store is set upon certainty and uniformity of application see too Great China Metal Industries Ltd v Malayasian International Shipping Corporation Berhad 1998 HCA 65  1988 196 CLR 161 at 186 71 per McHugh J   It is also important in construing international conventions that the views taken by courts particularly the Supreme Courts of nations are kept in mind so that there can be consistency in interpretation And I am conscious that in s 31 of the International Arbitration Act 1974 Cth the definition of arbitration agreement is that it is an agreement of the kind referred to in Art II r 2 As a matter of construction under Australian law I would have no hesitation in concluding that the definition was inclusive one However I think that the drafting of the definition in Art II r 2 invokes a concept of certainty that the arbitration clause or arbitration agreement is itself signed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams The precontractual exchanges of telexes and emails cannot themselves convert into separate or freestanding agreements in the present case unless and until the vessel was actually agreed to be fixed It was only upon the agreement to fix the vessel that it could be said to be under charter And as Capt Piperakis said he had imposed an absolute condition that a bank guarantee be provided The owners were not prepared to deliver the vessel on the evidence before me unless and until the bank guarantee had been received and it was at that point that they agreed that they were contractually bound That agreement which thus brought cl 45b into existence as an agreement to arbitrate was manifested by Comandate Marines conduct either in accepting the bank guarantee or later delivering the vessel At common law a recap telex can be found to contain a charter party including an arbitration clause which is incorporated by reference to an earlier telex or other communication even though both parties have not executed it The Epsilon Rosa 2003 2 Lloyds Rep 509 at 514 21 per Tuckey LJ May and Brooke LJJ agreeing But as Tuckey LJ pointed out 2003 2 Lloyds Rep at 515 29 one cannot generalize in these cases The act of acceptance which formed the contract was the provision of the bank guarantee And it is common ground that a formal charter party incorporating all of the agreed terms was to be prepared later by Prime on behalf of Comandate Marine Both parties were under a duty to cooperate to bring about the final form of their agreement in writing  Secured Income Real Estate Australia Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Limited 1979 HCA 51  1979 144 CLR 596 at 607 per Mason J applying Butt v MDonald 1896 7 QLJ 68 at 7071 per Griffith CJ No doubt cl 45b was part of the agreement between Pan and Comandate Marine But that does not of itself comply with Art II r 2 Rather the critical part of the conduct by which the contract was formed was the provision by a third party of the bank guarantee which brought the contract into existence So the contract being or including the arbitration agreement was not made by being signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of telexes or emails The contract included the conduct of the provision of the bank guarantee which fell outside the scope of Art II r 2 And because there is no evidence of any further written communication relied on as amounting to a document capable of being part of an exchange of letters or telegrams including telexes or emails then this series of communications does not satisfy the requirements of Art II r 2 A contract can be made by conduct evidencing a manifestation of assent to an offer Empirnall Holdings Pty Limited v Machon Paull Partners Pty Limited 1988 14 NSWLR 523 at 534535 per McHugh JA Samuels JA agreeing at 531 Accordingly I am of opinion that the telex from Prime to Mr Colaco headed FINAL RECAP was an offer by Comandate Marine to charter the vessel on the terms there set out and incorporated by reference which was capable of acceptance only by the provision of the bank guarantee For the reasons I have given based on the fairly settled interpretation of Art II r 2 that tacit acceptance is insufficient on the evidence I find that at the present time there is no agreement in writing for the purposes of Art II r 2 of the New York Convention  COMANDATE MARINES ALTERNATIVE CLAIM FOR STAY UNDER S 53 OF THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION ACT 1984 NSW   Comandate Marine argued that if an agreement in writing for the purposes of s 72 of the International Arbitration Act 1974 Cth were not found I should grant a stay pursuant to s 53 of the Commercial Arbitration Act 1984 NSW The Commercial Arbitration Act 1984 NSW provides that an arbitration agreement  means an agreement in writing to refer present or future disputes to arbitration see s 41 By s 531 the Court may stay the proceedings if it is satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration in accordance with the agreement and that the applicant was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration Having regard to the fact that Comandate Marine commenced its proceedings in rem as I have found without seeking to enforce any claim to arbitrate in those proceedings I am of opinion that the evidence establishes that Comandate Marine was not then ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration However its application for stay is made in Pans proceedings At the time when Pans proceedings were commenced Comandate Marine was pursuing the arbitration proceedings and still seeks to do so now I do not think that makes the commencement of the proceedings in rem irrelevant By s 532  the leave of the Court is required in the proceedings which have been commenced where the applicant for stay has delivered pleadings or taken any other steps in the proceedings other than the entry of an appearance Although Comandate Marines proceedings in rem were in separate proceedings they form as I have held part of the same matter for the purposes of ss 75 and 76 of the Constitution  and I am not minded to exercise any discretion in favour of Comandate Marine having regard to its conduct in taking the in rem proceedings in the circumstances which I have found  SCOPE OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE   Comandate Marine argued that the claims brought under ss 51A  52 and 55A of the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth and seeking relief under ss 82 and 87  including relief setting aside ab initio the charter party and preventing Comandate Marine from enforcing against the plaintiff any arbitral award were colourable It was not put that the claims were an abuse of the process of the Court Rather it was put in oral argument that there had been a misuse of s 12 of the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth because the very complaints the subject of the claims under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth were in essence the same as the breaches of contract relied on by Pan Comandate Marine in written submissions asserted that the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth claims had been made for the improper purpose of fabricating jurisdiction I do not think this argument has any substance Part V of the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth in which s 52 is found sets out a statutory norm of conduct to which corporations must conform in trade or commerce The task of the Court is to apply such norms where they arise in litigation even where the outcome is not materially different to applying the common law of negligence as in Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree 2005 HCA 69  2005 80 ALJR 183 at 191 29 per Gleeson CJ or of passing off as in Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd 2000 HCA 12  2000 202 CLR 45 at 83 97  In the latter case the whole court approved what Mason J had said in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd 1982 HCA 44  1982 149 CLR 191 at 205 see 202 CLR at 83 97 in the following terms   Likewise the operation of s 52 is not restricted by the common law principles relating to passingoff If as I consider the section provides the public with wider protection from deception than the common law it does not follow that there is a conflict between the section and the common law The statute provides an additional remedy  emphasis added   I am of opinion that the statutory remedy relied on by Pan is additional to whatever contractual remedies may be available to it and that there is no basis for the attribution to Pan of any improper purpose to fabricate jurisdiction The Parliament of the Commonwealth has enacted the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth under the trade and commerce power in s 51i of the Constitution  There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Pan has not properly and regularly invoked the Courts jurisdiction Pans pleading raises an issue of substance as to whether or not Comandate Marine engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct I am satisfied that this is truly part of the one controversy which the Court has been asked to quell cf DOrta Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid 2005 HCA 12  2005 79 ALJR 755 at 761 32  The only arguable limitation in the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth which might be seen as restricting the jurisdiction or powers any court invested with jurisdiction under that Act is to be found in s 13 But on examination s 13 does not affect the jurisdiction which a court including this Court has from sources other than the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth itself Rather s 13 provides that the Act does not confer on or invest jurisdiction on or in a court in a matter which is not of a kind mentioned in ss 76ii or iii of the Constitution  In ascertaining the scope of jurisdiction which the Federal Court may exercise s 13 thus provides some guidance It contemplates that matters of a kind mentioned in ss 76ii and iii of the Constitution can be within the jurisdiction of the Court Section 76iii of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction is a clear source of power to enact the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth itself and define maritime claims as well as associated matters of Admiralty and marine jurisdiction in ss 4 and 12  And s 76ii provides that the judicial power of the Commonwealth is invoked in any matter arising under any laws made by the Parliament The purpose of s 13 is to limit in the construction of the Act the conferral of jurisdiction by the Act to matters within the power of the Parliament and the judicial power of the Commonwealth It is not to limit the other powers of a court on or in which the Act confers or invests jurisdiction Clearly enough s 86 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth is a law made by the Parliament which confers jurisdiction on this Court independently of the jurisdiction conferred on it by the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth It is quite inappropriate to read provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court by making implications or imposing limitations which are not found in the express words Owners of Shin Kobe Maru v Empire Shipping Co Inc 1994 HCA 54  1994 181 CLR 404 at 421 see too Mansfield v Director of Public Prosecutions for Western Australia 2006 HCA 38 at 7  10 per Gleeson CJ Gummow Kirby Hayne and Crennan JJ Once the jurisdiction of this Court has been invoked the Court should exercise it  Re Wakim Ex parte McNally 1999 HCA 27  1999 198 CLR 511 at 588 149  even if it be to protect itself and its processes against

too at 6276 Comandate Marine also argued that a limitation was imposed on courts exercising jurisdiction conferred by the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth by s 31 But s 311 provides that the liability on a judgment of a relevant person defined by s 31 as a person who would be liable were the proceedings in personam brought against that person who has entered an appearance in a proceeding on a maritime claim commenced as an action in rem against a ship or property is not limited to the value of the ship or other property The section confirms the amplitude of the jurisdiction rather than restricts it Next Comandate Marine argued that a relevant person who appears in proceedings commenced by a writ in rem cannot be sued in proceedings in personam in this Court in respect of matters outside the relief claimed in the writ in rem on a cause of action other than a maritime claim within the meaning of s 4 of the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth or on associated matters of admiralty and marine jurisdiction within the meaning of s 12 of that Act Here part of the matter within the meaning of ss 76ii and iii of the Constitution  is the controversy between the parties under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth which Pan has pleaded The judicial power of the Commonwealth is exercised in resolving such matters Here the controversy involves claims under two Acts of the Parliament each of which specifically and independently one of the other confers jurisdiction on this Court Accordingly I am of opinion that this Court does have jurisdiction to hear and determine such an in personam proceeding as this That is not to say however that the ship or property the subject of the writ in rem will be available necessarily to answer any judgment for any in personam claim against a relevant person such as one under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth which is neither a maritime claim or an associated matter within the meaning of ss 4 or 12  I am of opinion that the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth cannot be construed as in any way limiting the jurisdiction of this Court to hear and determine any matter within its jurisdiction Rather appositely to the present proceedings there may be a question at the trial as to the availability of the bank guarantee which Comandate Marine provided as security in lieu of the ship Comandate to satisfy a claim made by Pan which is not within ss 4 or 12 of the Act Pans claim in personam for relief under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth is not invalid and its proceedings in personam are not invalidated by that claim s 51 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 Cth The Court at the final hearing can address any injustice which might arise if Comandate Marine wishes then to agitate such matters including whether the security provided should be available to satisfy any claim under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth The Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth provides Pan with remedies different to any remedy that could be awarded in pursuance of its contract claims Indeed one of the remedies it seeks is the avoidance of the contract not pursuant to contractual principles but by force of an order under s 87 of the Act Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Limited 2004 HCA 3  2004 216 CLR 388 at 409 52  And the High Court has emphasized that the remedies under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth are designed to give effect in cases of contravention of s 52  to the prescribed standards of conduct which are embodied in that section where activities occur in trade or commerce Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited 2000 HCA 12  2000 202 CLR 45 at 83 97  Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree 2005 HCA 69  2005 80 ALJR 183 International trade including the entry into charter parties for vessels is quintessentially within the trade and commerce clause of the Constitution s 51i And par 15 of the amended statement of claim pleads specifically that the relevant conduct occurred in Australia because the communications and representations were received by Mr Colaco in Australia see Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Limited 1990 HCA 55  1990 171 CLR 538 at 568 per Mason CJ Deane Dawson and Gaudron JJ Sydbank Soenderjylland AS v Bannerton Holdings Pty Ltd

Kiukiang Maritime Carriers Inc No 5 1998 90 FCR 1 In that case the relevant clause provided that any dispute arising from this charter would be settled in a London arbitration Obviously it is

the Model Law relevantly requires a court in which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement to refer the parties to arbitration if a party so requests no later than when submitting its first statement on the substance of the dispute 59 Russell on Arbitration 22 nd ed at 610 A5018 refers to Art 81 having the same effect as English law ie the party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement must apply to the court without delay for a stay of the proceedings op cit at 296 7005 The position is similar under s 532 of the Commercial Arbitration Act 1984 NSW which applies here by force of s 79 of the Judiciary Act 1903 Cth Comandate Marine did not apply to have its proceedings referred to arbitration when they were before this Court or the High Court I am of opinion that Comandate Marines conduct in bringing its proceedings in rem was incompatible with the arbitration agreement and that Art 81 and Art 9 of the Model Law do not avail it Comandate Marine is in a similar position to that of the landlord in the example given by Parker J in Matthews v Smallwood 1910 1 Ch at 786787 By pleading the writ in the way which it did Comandate Marine exercised a right of action given by the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth to litigate the breach of the charter party as a general maritime claim under s 43f of the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth in this Court I am of opinion that in choosing to claim only that relief when it invoked the jurisdiction of the Court Comandate Marine could not do that without prejudice to any right it might otherwise have had to seek security for the arbitration under s 29 at a later stage It made no such claim in the writ and it procured the arrest of the vessel for the purposes of the particular relief which it claimed in the writ The way in which Comandate Marine framed its claim in the writ nailed its colours to the mast as much as the warrant for arrest later was nailed notionally or actually to the mast of the Boomerang I  Having invoked the jurisdiction of the Court to procure the arrest of the vessel in order to pursue the only claims it pleaded it is not open to Comandate Marine now to say that it did so without prejudice to any right later to apply for security under s 29 of the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth In its report Civil Admiralty Jurisdiction Report No 33 1986 Law Reform Commission Australia the Commission recommended the introduction of what has become s 29 so as to enable the Admiralty jurisdiction to be used to obtain and retain security even though the merits of the dispute are to be determined elsewhere if the subject matter of the dispute lies within Admiralty jurisdiction The Commission noted that such a solution would do most to ensure that the award of the tribunal that decides upon the merits is satisfied and hence that a just result would be obtained It noted that the law had a strong interest in compliance with arbitral awards duly made and in achieving cooperation between courts and arbitrators to this end However the Commission desired in the solution it proposed that the Court should retain a discretion to stay or to exercise jurisdiction to decide the merits ALRC 33 189 That discretion was to arise in the Court being able to take into account all relevant circumstances although the Commission noted that as at 1986 English and South African courts required the plaintiff to demonstrate why the assistance of a court was required in retaining security although there were shades of difference between the readiness of the respective jurisdictions to assist in respect of claims otherwise unconnected with the forum The Tuyuti 1984 QB 838 at 851 Katagum Wholesale Commodities v The MV Paz 1984 3 SAf LR 261 at 268 270 Natal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa Neither party argued that the analysis of the present question should be approached on the basis that there had been a contract of abandonment such as in Paal Wilson  Co AS v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal 1983 1 AC 854 at 915916 There Lord Diplock considered that abandonment of a contract which was still executory involved the formation of a contract of abandonment in which each party promised to release the other from performance of all further obligations including the obligation to pay damages for past breaches arising under the executory and now abandoned contract Lord Brandon of Oakbrook who gave the leading speech see 1983 1 AC 900C per Lord Diplock said that the question of whether a contract has been abandoned or not is one of fact 1983 1 AC at 913F He continued 1983 1 AC at 914AC   The concept of the implied abandonment of a contract as a result of the conduct of the parties to it is well established in law  see Chitty on Contracts  23 rd ed 1968 vol 1 p 577 para 1231 and cases there cited Where A seeks to prove that he and B have abandoned a contract in this way there are two ways in which A can put his case The first way is by showing that the conduct of each party as evinced to the other party and acted on by him leads necessarily to the inference of an implied agreement between them to abandon the contract The second method is by showing that the conduct of B as evinced towards A has been such as to lead A reasonably to believe that B has abandoned the contract even though it has not in fact been Bs intention to do so and that A has significantly altered his position in reliance on that belief The first method involves actual abandonment by both A and B The second method involves the creation by B of a situation in which he is estopped from asserting as against A that he B has not abandoned the contract  Pearl Mill Co v Ivy Tannery Co Ltd 1919 1 KB 78    This contractual analysis is inapposite here but their Lordships approach shows that notwithstanding that arbitration proceedings have been regularly commenced and that both parties are bound to their pursuit the conduct of one party or both parties can bring about the legal consequence that the parties obligations to arbitrate in the arbitration proceedings have become abandoned or inoperative or incapable of being performed In international trade and commerce it is critical that the courts respect and enforce arbitration agreements where they exist in accordance with in particular the New York Convention and legislation designed to give effect to it such as the International Arbitration Act 1974 Cth This is because in international trade and commerce the parties generally will not wish to be subject to serendipity of where a ship may be arrested an action begun or damage occur to determine a forum of any litigation between them or the substantive law to be applied to their dispute The parties will be conscious that an accident or fortuity may occur at any point in a voyage or flight and very different legal results may flow depending on which law and which forum determine their dispute It is for this reason that arbitration clauses such as cl 45b invoking arbitration in London under English law have been a popular recourse for parties in international trade for over a century Nowadays other centres of commercial arbitration including Australia are recognized as providing sound and fair fora and laws for the resolution of disputes in international trade or commerce However the Court should be astute to uphold and enforce agreements such as those in cl 45b rather than to display a form of judicial prejudice or xenophobia against the parties chosen method or place of dispute resolution Refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate in international transactions is capable of undermining the reasonable but significant expectations of the international commercial community and the confidence which it and indeed local business people place in the readiness of courts to hold people to their bargains see eg Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v MV Sky Reefer 515 US 528 at 538 1995 Mitsubishi Motors Corp

which their disputes will be resolved by use of an arbitration agreement such as in cl 45b so they may also choose to give up their rights to use that method or they may so conduct themselves that the choice will be attributed to them by the doctrine of election When Comandate Marine chose to begin its in rem proceedings in the form which it utilized it brought about the consequence that it was taken to have elected not to pursue its arbitration proceedings It may have chosen another method to seek security by framing the relief it sought in its writ in a different way but it did not do so The English authorities on which Comandate Marine relied and to which Sheppard J referred did not consider the question of whether the party seeking security had made an election For that reason I think those authorities are distinguishable Because Comandate Marine elected to litigate the dispute and Pan has too the arbitration agreement in cl 45b has been in substance abandoned or for the purposes of s 75 of the International Arbitration Act 1974 Cth rendered inoperative or incapable of being performed  WAS THERE AN AGREEMENT IN WRITING   Pan argues that Art II r 2 of the New York Convention requires there to be either an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement which is either signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams Pan says that where the contract was formed as it argues the charter party was in this case either by acts or conduct Art II r 2 is not satisfied Pan says that each of the provision of the bank guarantee or the delivery of the vessel was an act or amounted to conduct which brought the contract into existence In support of the argument it relies on decision of the Supreme Court of Italy in Robobar Limited v Finncold SaS 1995 Year Book Comm Arbn XX 739 at 740 The Court held that where a purchase confirmation had been sent by the party seeking to rely on the arbitration clause to which the other party had not responded there was no doubt that none of the formalities in Art II in the New York Convention had been met because the clause was only contained in the confirmation to which the other party had not agreed by letter or telegram Pan also relied on a decision of the Court of Appeal of the Federal Republic of Germany in a case between a Dutch seller and a German buyer 1997 Year Book Comm Arbn Vol II 237 at 238 The Court of Appeal held that a declaration in writing of both sides to the contract was required A one sided confirmation did not suffice and the lack of declaration in writing by the other party could not be cured by that partys appearance in the arbitration In this matter however the critical telex of 20 April 2006 commenced by being in form a confirmation but ended with a request being made to both parties to confirm that the above recap was in line with the negotiations agreed so far The next relevant correspondence was the telex later that day noting that the bank guarantee had been received and indicating when delivery would occur I think this does fall within the positions contemplated by the Supreme Court of Italy and the German Court of Appeal as being ones in which the contract was not formed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams And In Zambia Steel  Building Supplies Ltd v James Clark  Eaton Ltd 1986 2 Lloyds Rep 225 at 234 Ralph Gibson LJ said   It is clear to me that the New York Convention by Art II par 2 did not impose upon the contracting state an obligation to recognise an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration unless it is signed by the parties or unless the agreement is contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams in the sense that the assent to be bound by both parties is given in writing by such document    The Manitoba Court of Appeal noted in Proctor v Schellenberg 2003 2 WWR 621 at 628 18 that Art IV r 1b of the New York Convention requires a party seeking to obtain recognition and enforcement of an award to provide the original agreement referred to in article II or a duly certified copy thereof They said that  there had to be a record to evidence the agreement of the parties to resolve the dispute by arbitral process in concluding that facsimile transmissions were sufficient to be or form part of an agreement in writing In AJ van den Bergs The New York Arbitration Convention of 1958 1981 at 196198 206 277 the learned author notes that Art II r 2 excludes oral or tacit acceptance and concluded at 197 227 that as at 1981 there had been only one  exception to the unanimous judicial affirmation that tacit acceptance does not comply with Art II r 2 that being a decision of the Court of First Instance of Rotterdam The learned author said that this decision was not in conformity with either the text of Art II r 2 or the intent of its drafters and noted that the decision had been rightly criticised Significantly he referred to the history of Art II r 2 which confirmed that the drafters of the New York Convention wished to exclude from its scope oral or tacit acceptance of a written proposal to arbitrate In his article Is the need for writing as expressed in the New York Convention and the Model Law out of step with commercial practice   1996 International Arbitration vol 12 no 1 p 27 at 32 Neil Kaplan QC affirmed Prof van den Bergs interpretation Mr Kaplan referred

Limited v Goldroyce Garment Limited 1994 2 HKC 526 HCMP000 9081994 that there was no basis for arguing that an arbitration agreement could be established by a course of dealing or the conduct of the parties under Art VII of the Model Law see Schedule 2 to the International Arbitration Act 1974 Cth Kaplan J said that he had looked at the UNCITRAL reports in relation to Art VII and was quite satisfied that it could not be complied with unless there was a record in which the defendant in writing assented to the agreement to arbitrate see at 12 It has been recognized that a national courts in the interest of uniformity should construe rules formulated by an international convention especially rules formulated for the purpose of governing international transactions such as the hire of vessels or the carriage of goods in a normal manner appropriate for the interpretation of an international convention unconstrained by technical rules of English or domestic law or by English or domestic legal precedent but on broad principles of general acceptation Shipping Corporation of India Ltd v Gamlen Chemical Co Australasia Pty Ltd 1980 HCA 51  1980 147 CLR 142 at 159 per Mason and

uniformity of application see too Great China Metal Industries Ltd v Malayasian International Shipping Corporation Berhad 1998 HCA 65  1988 196 CLR 161 at 186 71 per McHugh J   It is also important in construing international conventions that the views taken by courts particularly the Supreme Courts of nations are kept in mind so that there can be consistency in interpretation And I am conscious that in s 31 of the International Arbitration Act 1974 Cth the definition of arbitration agreement is that it is an agreement of the kind referred to in Art II r 2 As a matter of construction under Australian law I would have no hesitation in concluding that the definition was inclusive one However I think that the drafting of the definition in Art II r 2 invokes a concept of certainty that the arbitration clause or arbitration agreement is itself signed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams The precontractual exchanges of telexes and emails cannot themselves convert into separate or freestanding agreements in the present case unless and until the vessel was actually agreed to be fixed It was only upon the agreement to fix the vessel that it could be said to be under charter And as Capt Piperakis said he had imposed an absolute condition that a bank guarantee be provided The owners were not prepared to deliver the vessel on the evidence before me unless and until the bank guarantee had been received and it was at that point that they agreed that they were contractually bound That agreement which thus brought cl 45b into existence as an agreement to arbitrate was manifested by Comandate Marines conduct either in accepting the bank guarantee or later delivering the vessel At common law a recap telex can be found to contain a charter party including an arbitration clause which is incorporated by reference to an earlier telex or other communication even though both parties have not executed it The Epsilon Rosa 2003 2 Lloyds Rep 509 at 514 21 per Tuckey LJ May and Brooke LJJ agreeing But as Tuckey LJ pointed out 2003 2 Lloyds Rep at 515 29 one cannot generalize in these cases The act of acceptance which formed the contract was the provision of the bank guarantee And it is common ground that a formal charter party incorporating all of the agreed terms was to be prepared later by Prime on behalf of Comandate Marine Both parties were under a duty to cooperate to bring about the final form of their agreement in writing  Secured Income Real Estate Australia Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Limited 1979 HCA 51  1979 144 CLR 596 at 607 per Mason J applying Butt v MDonald 1896 7 QLJ 68 at 7071 per Griffith CJ No doubt cl 45b was part of the agreement between Pan and Comandate Marine But that does not of itself comply with Art II r 2 Rather the critical part of the conduct by which the contract was formed was the provision by a third party of the bank guarantee which brought the contract into existence So the contract being or including the arbitration agreement was not made by being signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of telexes or emails The contract included the conduct of the provision of the bank guarantee which fell outside the scope of Art II r 2 And because there is no evidence of any further written communication relied on as amounting to a document capable of being part of an exchange of letters or telegrams including telexes or emails then this series of communications does not satisfy the requirements of Art II r 2 A contract can be made by conduct evidencing a manifestation of assent to an offer Empirnall Holdings Pty Limited v Machon Paull Partners Pty Limited 1988 14 NSWLR 523 at 534535 per McHugh JA Samuels JA agreeing at 531 Accordingly I am of opinion that the telex from Prime to Mr Colaco headed FINAL RECAP was an offer by Comandate Marine to charter the vessel on the terms there set out and incorporated by reference which was capable of acceptance only by the provision of the bank guarantee For the reasons I have given based on the fairly settled interpretation of Art II r 2 that tacit acceptance is insufficient on the evidence I find that at the present time there is no agreement in writing for the purposes of Art II r 2 of the New York Convention  COMANDATE MARINES ALTERNATIVE CLAIM FOR STAY UNDER S 53 OF THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION ACT 1984 NSW   Comandate Marine argued that if an agreement in writing for the purposes of s 72 of the International Arbitration Act 1974 Cth were not found I should grant a stay pursuant to s 53 of the Commercial Arbitration Act 1984 NSW The Commercial Arbitration Act 1984 NSW provides that an arbitration agreement  means an agreement in writing to refer present or future disputes to arbitration see s 41 By s 531 the Court may stay the proceedings if it is satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration in accordance with the agreement and that the applicant was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration Having regard to the fact that Comandate Marine commenced its proceedings in rem as I have found without seeking to enforce any claim to arbitrate in those proceedings I am of opinion that the evidence establishes that Comandate Marine was not then ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration However its application for stay is made in Pans proceedings At the time when Pans proceedings were commenced Comandate Marine was pursuing the arbitration proceedings and still seeks to do so now I do not think that makes the commencement of the proceedings in rem irrelevant By s 532  the leave of the Court is required in the proceedings which have been commenced where the applicant for stay has delivered pleadings or taken any other steps in the proceedings other than the entry of an appearance Although Comandate Marines proceedings in rem were in separate proceedings they form as I have held part of the same matter for the purposes of ss 75 and 76 of the Constitution  and I am not minded to exercise any discretion in favour of Comandate Marine having regard to its conduct in taking the in rem proceedings in the circumstances which I have found  SCOPE OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE   Comandate Marine argued that the claims brought under ss 51A  52 and 55A of the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth and seeking relief under ss 82 and 87  including relief setting aside ab initio the charter party and preventing Comandate Marine from enforcing against the plaintiff any arbitral award were colourable It was not put that the claims were an abuse of the process of the Court Rather it was put in oral argument that there had been a misuse of s 12 of the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth because the very complaints the subject of the claims under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth were in essence the same as the breaches of contract relied on by Pan Comandate Marine in written submissions asserted that the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth claims had been made for the improper purpose of fabricating jurisdiction I do not think this argument has any substance Part V of the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth in which s 52 is found sets out a statutory norm of conduct to which corporations must conform in trade or commerce The task of the Court is to apply such norms where they arise in litigation even where the outcome is not materially different to applying the common law of negligence as in Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree 2005 HCA 69  2005 80 ALJR 183 at 191 29 per Gleeson CJ or of passing off as in Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd 2000 HCA 12  2000 202 CLR 45 at 83 97  In the latter case the whole court approved what Mason J had said in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd 1982 HCA 44  1982 149 CLR 191 at 205 see 202 CLR at 83 97 in the following terms   Likewise the operation of s 52 is not restricted by the common law principles relating to passingoff If as I consider the section provides the public with wider protection from deception than the common law it does not follow that there is a conflict between the section and the common law The statute provides an additional remedy  emphasis added   I am of opinion that the statutory remedy relied on by Pan is additional to whatever contractual remedies may be available to it and that there is no basis for the attribution to Pan of any improper purpose to fabricate jurisdiction The Parliament of the Commonwealth has enacted the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth under the trade and commerce power in s 51i of the Constitution  There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Pan has not properly and regularly invoked the Courts jurisdiction Pans pleading raises an issue of substance as to whether or not Comandate Marine engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct I am satisfied that this is truly part of the one controversy which the Court has been asked to quell cf DOrta Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid 2005 HCA 12  2005 79 ALJR 755 at 761 32  The only arguable limitation in the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth which might be seen as restricting the jurisdiction or powers any court invested with jurisdiction under that Act is to be found in s 13 But on examination s 13 does not affect the jurisdiction which a court including this Court has from sources other than the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth itself Rather s 13 provides that the Act does not confer on or invest jurisdiction on or in a court in a matter which is not of a kind mentioned in ss 76ii or iii of the Constitution  In ascertaining the scope of jurisdiction which the Federal Court may exercise s 13 thus provides some guidance It contemplates that matters of a kind mentioned in ss 76ii and iii of the Constitution can be within the jurisdiction of the Court Section 76iii of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction is a clear source of power to enact the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth itself and define maritime claims as well as associated matters of Admiralty and marine jurisdiction in ss 4 and 12  And s 76ii provides that the judicial power of the Commonwealth is invoked in any matter arising under any laws made by the Parliament The purpose of s 13 is to limit in the construction of the Act the conferral of jurisdiction by the Act to matters within the power of the Parliament and the judicial power of the Commonwealth It is not to limit the other powers of a court on or in which the Act confers or invests jurisdiction Clearly enough s 86 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth is a law made by the Parliament which confers jurisdiction on this Court independently of the jurisdiction conferred on it by the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth It is quite inappropriate to read provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court by making implications or imposing limitations which are not found in the express words Owners of Shin Kobe Maru v Empire Shipping Co Inc 1994 HCA 54  1994 181 CLR 404 at 421 see too Mansfield v Director of Public Prosecutions for Western Australia 2006 HCA 38 at 7  10 per Gleeson CJ Gummow Kirby Hayne and Crennan JJ Once the jurisdiction of this Court has been invoked the Court should exercise it  Re Wakim Ex parte McNally

and Crennan JJ see too Elbe Shipping SA v The Ship Global Peace 2006 FCA 954 at 138 per Allsop J see too at 6276 Comandate Marine also argued that a limitation was imposed on courts exercising jurisdiction conferred by the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth by s 31 But s 311 provides that the liability on a judgment of a relevant person defined by s 31 as a person who would be liable were the proceedings in personam brought against that person who has entered an appearance in a proceeding on a maritime claim commenced as an action in rem against a ship or property is not limited to the value of the ship or other property The section confirms the amplitude of the jurisdiction rather than restricts it Next Comandate Marine argued that a relevant person who appears in proceedings commenced by a writ in rem cannot be sued in proceedings in personam in this Court in respect of matters outside the relief claimed in the writ in rem on a cause of action other than a maritime claim within the meaning of s 4 of the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth or on associated matters of admiralty and marine jurisdiction within the meaning of s 12 of that Act Here part of the matter within the meaning of ss 76ii and iii of the Constitution  is the controversy between the parties under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth which Pan has pleaded The judicial power of the Commonwealth is exercised in resolving such matters Here the controversy involves claims under two Acts of the Parliament each of which specifically and independently one of the other confers jurisdiction on this Court Accordingly I am of opinion that this Court does have jurisdiction to hear and determine such an in personam proceeding as this That is not to say however that the ship or property the subject of the writ in rem will be available necessarily to answer any judgment for any in personam claim against a relevant person such as one under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth which is neither a maritime claim or an associated matter within the meaning of ss 4 or 12  I am of opinion that the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth cannot be construed as in any way limiting the jurisdiction of this Court to hear and determine any matter within its jurisdiction Rather appositely to the present proceedings there may be a question at the trial as to the availability of the bank guarantee which Comandate Marine provided as security in lieu of the ship Comandate to satisfy a claim made by Pan which is not within ss 4 or 12 of the Act Pans claim in personam for relief under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth is not invalid and its proceedings in personam are not invalidated by that claim s 51 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 Cth The Court at the final hearing can address any injustice which might arise if Comandate Marine wishes then to agitate such matters including whether the security provided should be available to satisfy any claim under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth The Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth provides Pan with remedies different to any remedy that could be awarded in pursuance of its contract claims Indeed one of the remedies it seeks is the avoidance of the contract not pursuant to contractual principles but by force of an order under s 87 of the Act Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Limited 2004 HCA 3  2004 216 CLR 388 at 409 52  And the High Court has emphasized that the remedies under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth are designed to give effect in cases of contravention of s 52  to the prescribed standards of conduct which are embodied in that section where activities occur in trade or commerce Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited 2000 HCA 12  2000 202 CLR 45 at 83 97  Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree 2005 HCA 69  2005 80 ALJR 183 International trade including the entry into charter parties for vessels is quintessentially within the trade and commerce clause of the Constitution s 51i And par 15 of the amended statement of claim pleads specifically that the relevant conduct occurred in Australia because the communications and representations were received by Mr Colaco in Australia see Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Limited

Model Law relevantly requires a court in which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement to refer the parties to arbitration if a party so requests no later than when submitting its first statement on the substance of the dispute 59 Russell on Arbitration 22 nd ed at 610 A5018 refers to Art 81 having the same effect as English law ie the party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement must apply to the court without delay for a stay of the proceedings op cit at 296 7005 The position is similar under s 532 of the Commercial Arbitration Act 1984 NSW which applies here by force of s 79 of the Judiciary Act 1903 Cth Comandate Marine did not apply to have its proceedings referred to arbitration when they were before this Court or the High Court I am of opinion that Comandate Marines conduct in bringing its proceedings in rem was incompatible with the arbitration agreement and that Art 81 and Art 9 of the Model Law do not avail it Comandate Marine is in a similar position to that of the landlord in the example given by Parker J in Matthews v Smallwood 1910 1 Ch at 786787 By pleading the writ in the way which it did Comandate Marine exercised a right of action given by the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth to litigate the breach of the charter party as a general maritime claim under s 43f of the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth in this Court I am of opinion that in choosing to claim only that relief when it invoked the jurisdiction of the Court Comandate Marine could not do that without prejudice to any right it might otherwise have had to seek security for the arbitration under s 29 at a later stage It made no such claim in the writ and it procured the arrest of the vessel for the purposes of the particular relief which it claimed in the writ The way in which Comandate Marine framed its claim in the writ nailed its colours to the mast as much as the warrant for arrest later was nailed notionally or actually to the mast of the Boomerang I  Having invoked the jurisdiction of the Court to procure the arrest of the vessel in order to pursue the only claims it pleaded it is not open to Comandate Marine now to say that it did so without prejudice to any right later to apply for security under s 29 of the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth In its report Civil Admiralty Jurisdiction Report No 33 1986 Law Reform Commission Australia the Commission recommended the introduction of what has become s 29 so as to enable the Admiralty jurisdiction to be used to obtain and retain security even though the merits of the dispute are to be determined elsewhere if the subject matter of the dispute lies within Admiralty jurisdiction The Commission noted that such a solution would do most to ensure that the award of the tribunal that decides upon the merits is satisfied and hence that a just result would be obtained It noted that the law had a strong interest in compliance with arbitral awards duly made and in achieving cooperation between courts and arbitrators to this end However the Commission desired in the solution it proposed that the Court should retain a discretion to stay or to exercise jurisdiction to decide the merits ALRC 33 189 That discretion was to arise in the Court being able to take into account all relevant circumstances although the Commission noted that as at 1986 English and South African courts required the plaintiff to demonstrate why the assistance of a court was required in retaining security although there were shades of difference between the readiness of the respective jurisdictions to assist in respect of claims otherwise unconnected with the forum The Tuyuti 1984 QB 838 at 851 Katagum Wholesale Commodities v The MV Paz 1984 3 SAf LR 261 at 268 270 Natal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa Neither party argued that the analysis of the present question should be approached on the basis that there had been a contract of abandonment such as in Paal Wilson  Co AS v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal 1983 1 AC 854 at 915916 There Lord Diplock considered that abandonment of a contract which was still executory involved the formation of a contract of abandonment in which each party promised to release the other from performance of all further obligations including the obligation to pay damages for past breaches arising under the executory and now abandoned contract Lord Brandon of Oakbrook who gave the leading speech see 1983 1 AC 900C per Lord Diplock said that the question of whether a contract has been abandoned or not is one of fact 1983 1 AC at 913F He continued 1983 1 AC at 914AC   The concept of the implied abandonment of a contract as a result of the conduct of the parties to it is well established in law  see Chitty on Contracts  23 rd ed 1968 vol 1 p 577 para 1231 and cases there cited Where A seeks to prove that he and B have abandoned a contract in this way there are two ways in which A can put his case The first way is by showing that the conduct of each party as evinced to the other party and acted on by him leads necessarily to the inference of an implied agreement between them to abandon the contract The second method is by showing that the conduct of B as evinced towards A has been such as to lead A reasonably to believe that B has abandoned the contract even though it has not in fact been Bs intention to do so and that A has significantly altered his position in reliance on that belief The first method involves actual abandonment by both A and B The second method involves the creation by B of a situation in which he is estopped from asserting as against A that he B has not abandoned the contract  Pearl Mill Co v Ivy Tannery Co Ltd 1919 1 KB 78    This contractual analysis is inapposite here but their Lordships approach shows that notwithstanding that arbitration proceedings have been regularly commenced and that both parties are bound to their pursuit the conduct of one party or both parties can bring about the legal consequence that the parties obligations to arbitrate in the arbitration proceedings have become abandoned or inoperative or incapable of being performed In international trade and commerce it is critical that the courts respect and enforce arbitration agreements where they exist in accordance with in particular the New York Convention and legislation designed to give effect to it such as the International Arbitration Act 1974 Cth This is because in international trade and commerce the parties generally will not wish to be subject to serendipity of where a ship may be arrested an action begun or damage occur to determine a forum of any litigation between them or the substantive law to be applied to their dispute The parties will be conscious that an accident or fortuity may occur at any point in a voyage or flight and very different legal results may flow depending on which law and which forum determine their dispute It is for this reason that arbitration clauses such as cl 45b invoking arbitration in London under English law have been a popular recourse for parties in international trade for over a century Nowadays other centres of commercial arbitration including Australia are recognized as providing sound and fair fora and laws for the resolution of disputes in international trade or commerce However the Court should be astute to uphold and enforce agreements such as those in cl 45b rather than to display a form of judicial prejudice or xenophobia against the parties chosen method or place of dispute resolution Refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate in international transactions is capable of undermining the reasonable but significant expectations of the international commercial community and the confidence which it and indeed local business people place in the readiness of courts to hold people to their bargains see eg Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v MV Sky Reefer 515 US 528 at 538 1995 Mitsubishi Motors Corp

which their disputes will be resolved by use of an arbitration agreement such as in cl 45b so they may also choose to give up their rights to use that method or they may so conduct themselves that the choice will be attributed to them by the doctrine of election When Comandate Marine chose to begin its in rem proceedings in the form which it utilized it brought about the consequence that it was taken to have elected not to pursue its arbitration proceedings It may have chosen another method to seek security by framing the relief it sought in its writ in a different way but it did not do so The English authorities on which Comandate Marine relied and to which Sheppard J referred did not consider the question of whether the party seeking security had made an election For that reason I think those authorities are distinguishable Because Comandate Marine elected to litigate the dispute and Pan has too the arbitration agreement in cl 45b has been in substance abandoned or for the purposes of s 75 of the International Arbitration Act 1974 Cth rendered inoperative or incapable of being performed  WAS THERE AN AGREEMENT IN WRITING   Pan argues that Art II r 2 of the New York Convention requires there to be either an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement which is either signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams Pan says that where the contract was formed as it argues the charter party was in this case either by acts or conduct Art II r 2 is not satisfied Pan says that each of the provision of the bank guarantee or the delivery of the vessel was an act or amounted to conduct which brought the contract into existence In support of the argument it relies on decision of the Supreme Court of Italy in Robobar Limited v Finncold SaS 1995 Year Book Comm Arbn XX 739 at 740 The Court held that where a purchase confirmation had been sent by the party seeking to rely on the arbitration clause to which the other party had not responded there was no doubt that none of the formalities in Art II in the New York Convention had been met because the clause was only contained in the confirmation to which the other party had not agreed by letter or telegram Pan also relied on a decision of the Court of Appeal of the Federal Republic of Germany in a case between a Dutch seller and a German buyer 1997 Year Book Comm Arbn Vol II 237 at 238 The Court of Appeal held that a declaration in writing of both sides to the contract was required A one sided confirmation did not suffice and the lack of declaration in writing by the other party could not be cured by that partys appearance in the arbitration In this matter however the critical telex of 20 April 2006 commenced by being in form a confirmation but ended with a request being made to both parties to confirm that the above recap was in line with the negotiations agreed so far The next relevant correspondence was the telex later that day noting that the bank guarantee had been received and indicating when delivery would occur I think this does fall within the positions contemplated by the Supreme Court of Italy and the German Court of Appeal as being ones in which the contract was not formed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams And In Zambia Steel  Building Supplies Ltd v James Clark  Eaton Ltd 1986 2 Lloyds Rep 225 at 234 Ralph Gibson LJ said   It is clear to me that the New York Convention by Art II par 2 did not impose upon the contracting state an obligation to recognise an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration unless it is signed by the parties or unless the agreement is contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams in the sense that the assent to be bound by both parties is given in writing by such document    The Manitoba Court of Appeal noted in Proctor v Schellenberg 2003 2 WWR 621 at 628 18 that Art IV r 1b of the New York Convention requires a party seeking to obtain recognition and enforcement of an award to provide the original agreement referred to in article II or a duly certified copy thereof They said that  there had to be a record to evidence the agreement of the parties to resolve the dispute by arbitral process in concluding that facsimile transmissions were sufficient to be or form part of an agreement in writing In AJ van den Bergs The New York Arbitration Convention of 1958 1981 at 196198 206 277 the learned author notes that Art II r 2 excludes oral or tacit acceptance and concluded at 197 227 that as at 1981 there had been only one  exception to the unanimous judicial affirmation that tacit acceptance does not comply with Art II r 2 that being a decision of the Court of First Instance of Rotterdam The learned author said that this decision was not in conformity with either the text of Art II r 2 or the intent of its drafters and noted that the decision had been rightly criticised Significantly he referred to the history of Art II r 2 which confirmed that the drafters of the New York Convention wished to exclude from its scope oral or tacit acceptance of a written proposal to arbitrate In his article Is the need for writing as expressed in the New York Convention and the Model Law out of step with commercial practice   1996 International Arbitration vol 12 no 1 p 27 at 32 Neil Kaplan QC affirmed Prof van den Bergs interpretation Mr Kaplan referred

Limited v Goldroyce Garment Limited 1994 2 HKC 526 HCMP000 9081994 that there was no basis for arguing that an arbitration agreement could be established by a course of dealing or the conduct of the parties under Art VII of the Model Law see Schedule 2 to the International Arbitration Act 1974 Cth Kaplan J said that he had looked at the UNCITRAL reports in relation to Art VII and was quite satisfied that it could not be complied with unless there was a record in which the defendant in writing assented to the agreement to arbitrate see at 12 It has been recognized that a national courts in the interest of uniformity should construe rules formulated by an international convention especially rules formulated for the purpose of governing international transactions such as the hire of vessels or the carriage of goods in a normal manner appropriate for the interpretation of an international convention unconstrained by technical rules of English or domestic law or by English or domestic legal precedent but on broad principles of general acceptation Shipping Corporation of India Ltd v Gamlen Chemical Co Australasia Pty Ltd 1980 HCA 51  1980 147 CLR 142 at 159 per Mason and

537 1995 per Kennedy J Renquist CJ Scalia Souter Thomas and Ginsberg JJ agreeing Mason and Wilson JJ went on to say 147 CLR at 159   It is important that we should adhere to this approach when we are interpreting rules which have been formulated for the purpose of regulating the rights and liabilities of parties to international mercantile transactions where great store is set upon certainty and uniformity of application see too Great China Metal Industries Ltd v Malayasian International Shipping Corporation Berhad 1998 HCA 65  1988 196 CLR 161 at 186 71 per McHugh J   It is also important in construing international conventions that the views taken by courts particularly the Supreme Courts of nations are kept in mind so that there can be consistency in interpretation And I am conscious that in s 31 of the International Arbitration Act 1974 Cth the definition of arbitration agreement is that it is an agreement of the kind referred to in Art II r 2 As a matter of construction under Australian law I would have no hesitation in concluding that the definition was inclusive one However I think that the drafting of the definition in Art II r 2 invokes a concept of certainty that the arbitration clause or arbitration agreement is itself signed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams The precontractual exchanges of telexes and emails cannot themselves convert into separate or freestanding agreements in the present case unless and until the vessel was actually agreed to be fixed It was only upon the agreement to fix the vessel that it could be said to be under charter And as Capt Piperakis said he had imposed an absolute condition that a bank guarantee be provided The owners were not prepared to deliver the vessel on the evidence before me unless and until the bank guarantee had been received and it was at that point that they agreed that they were contractually bound That agreement which thus brought cl 45b into existence as an agreement to arbitrate was manifested by Comandate Marines conduct either in accepting the bank guarantee or later delivering the vessel At common law a recap telex can be found to contain a charter party including an arbitration clause which is incorporated by reference to an earlier telex or other communication even though both parties have not executed it The Epsilon Rosa 2003 2 Lloyds Rep 509 at 514 21 per Tuckey LJ May and Brooke LJJ agreeing But as Tuckey LJ pointed out 2003 2 Lloyds Rep at 515 29 one cannot generalize in these cases The act of acceptance which formed the contract was the provision of the bank guarantee And it is common ground that a formal charter party incorporating all of the agreed terms was to be prepared later by Prime on behalf of Comandate Marine Both parties were under a duty to cooperate to bring about the final form of their agreement in writing  Secured Income Real Estate Australia Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Limited 1979 HCA 51  1979 144 CLR 596 at 607 per Mason J applying Butt v MDonald 1896 7 QLJ 68 at 7071 per Griffith CJ No doubt cl 45b was part of the agreement between Pan and Comandate Marine But that does not of itself comply with Art II r 2 Rather the critical part of the conduct by which the contract was formed was the provision by a third party of the bank guarantee which brought the contract into existence So the contract being or including the arbitration agreement was not made by being signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of telexes or emails The contract included the conduct of the provision of the bank guarantee which fell outside the scope of Art II r 2 And because there is no evidence of any further written communication relied on as amounting to a document capable of being part of an exchange of letters or telegrams including telexes or emails then this series of communications does not satisfy the requirements of Art II r 2 A contract can be made by conduct evidencing a manifestation of assent to an offer Empirnall Holdings Pty Limited v Machon Paull Partners Pty Limited 1988 14 NSWLR 523 at 534535 per McHugh JA Samuels JA agreeing at 531 Accordingly I am of opinion that the telex from Prime to Mr Colaco headed FINAL RECAP was an offer by Comandate Marine to charter the vessel on the terms there set out and incorporated by reference which was capable of acceptance only by the provision of the bank guarantee For the reasons I have given based on the fairly settled interpretation of Art II r 2 that tacit acceptance is insufficient on the evidence I find that at the present time there is no agreement in writing for the purposes of Art II r 2 of the New York Convention  COMANDATE MARINES ALTERNATIVE CLAIM FOR STAY UNDER S 53 OF THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION ACT 1984 NSW   Comandate Marine argued that if an agreement in writing for the purposes of s 72 of the International Arbitration Act 1974 Cth were not found I should grant a stay pursuant to s 53 of the Commercial Arbitration Act 1984 NSW The Commercial Arbitration Act 1984 NSW provides that an arbitration agreement  means an agreement in writing to refer present or future disputes to arbitration see s 41 By s 531 the Court may stay the proceedings if it is satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration in accordance with the agreement and that the applicant was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration Having regard to the fact that Comandate Marine commenced its proceedings in rem as I have found without seeking to enforce any claim to arbitrate in those proceedings I am of opinion that the evidence establishes that Comandate Marine was not then ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration However its application for stay is made in Pans proceedings At the time when Pans proceedings were commenced Comandate Marine was pursuing the arbitration proceedings and still seeks to do so now I do not think that makes the commencement of the proceedings in rem irrelevant By s 532  the leave of the Court is required in the proceedings which have been commenced where the applicant for stay has delivered pleadings or taken any other steps in the proceedings other than the entry of an appearance Although Comandate Marines proceedings in rem were in separate proceedings they form as I have held part of the same matter for the purposes of ss 75 and 76 of the Constitution  and I am not minded to exercise any discretion in favour of Comandate Marine having regard to its conduct in taking the in rem proceedings in the circumstances which I have found  SCOPE OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE   Comandate Marine argued that the claims brought under ss 51A  52 and 55A of the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth and seeking relief under ss 82 and 87  including relief setting aside ab initio the charter party and preventing Comandate Marine from enforcing against the plaintiff any arbitral award were colourable It was not put that the claims were an abuse of the process of the Court Rather it was put in oral argument that there had been a misuse of s 12 of the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth because the very complaints the subject of the claims under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth were in essence the same as the breaches of contract relied on by Pan Comandate Marine in written submissions asserted that the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth claims had been made for the improper purpose of fabricating jurisdiction I do not think this argument has any substance Part V of the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth in which s 52 is found sets out a statutory norm of conduct to which corporations must conform in trade or commerce The task of the Court is to apply such norms where they arise in litigation even where the outcome is not materially different to applying the common law

at 83 97 in the following terms   Likewise the operation of s 52 is not restricted by the common law principles relating to passingoff If as I consider the section provides the public with wider protection from deception than the common law it does not follow that there is a conflict between the section and the common law The statute provides an additional remedy  emphasis added   I am of opinion that the statutory remedy relied on by Pan is additional to whatever contractual remedies may be available to it and that there is no basis for the attribution to Pan of any improper purpose to fabricate jurisdiction The Parliament of the Commonwealth has enacted the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth under the trade and commerce power in s 51i of the Constitution  There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Pan has not properly and regularly invoked the Courts jurisdiction Pans pleading raises an issue of substance as to whether or not Comandate Marine engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct I am satisfied that this is truly part of the one controversy which the Court has been asked to quell cf DOrta Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid 2005 HCA 12  2005 79 ALJR 755 at 761 32  The only arguable limitation in the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth which might be seen as restricting the jurisdiction or powers any court invested with jurisdiction under that Act is to be found in s 13 But on examination s 13 does not affect the jurisdiction which a court including this Court has from sources other than the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth itself Rather s 13 provides that the Act does not confer on or invest jurisdiction on or in a court in a matter which is not of a kind mentioned in ss 76ii or iii of the Constitution  In ascertaining the scope of jurisdiction which the Federal Court may exercise s 13 thus provides some guidance It contemplates that matters of a kind mentioned in ss 76ii and iii of the Constitution can be within the jurisdiction of the Court Section 76iii of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction is a clear source of power to enact the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth itself and define maritime claims as well as associated matters of Admiralty and marine jurisdiction in ss 4 and 12  And s 76ii provides that the judicial power of the Commonwealth is invoked in any matter arising under any laws made by the Parliament The purpose of s 13 is to limit in the construction of the Act the conferral of jurisdiction by the Act to matters within the power of the Parliament and the judicial power of the Commonwealth It is not to limit the other powers of a court on or in which the Act confers or invests jurisdiction Clearly enough s 86 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth is a law made by the Parliament which confers jurisdiction on this Court independently of the jurisdiction conferred on it by the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth It is quite inappropriate to read provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court by making implications or imposing limitations which are not found in the express words Owners of Shin Kobe Maru v Empire Shipping Co Inc 1994 HCA 54  1994 181 CLR 404 at 421 see too Mansfield v Director of Public Prosecutions for

and Crennan JJ see too Elbe Shipping SA v The Ship Global Peace 2006 FCA 954 at 138 per Allsop J see too at 6276 Comandate Marine also argued that a limitation was imposed on courts exercising jurisdiction conferred by the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth by s 31 But s 311 provides that the liability on a judgment of a relevant person defined by s 31 as a person who would be liable were the proceedings in personam brought against that person who has entered an appearance in a proceeding on a maritime claim commenced as an action in rem against a ship or property is not limited to the value of the ship or other property The section confirms the amplitude of the jurisdiction rather than restricts it Next Comandate Marine argued that a relevant person who appears in proceedings commenced by a writ in rem cannot be sued in proceedings in personam in this Court in respect of matters outside the relief claimed in the writ in rem on a cause of action other than a maritime claim within the meaning of s 4 of the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth or on associated matters of admiralty and marine jurisdiction within the meaning of s 12 of that Act Here part of the matter within the meaning of ss 76ii and iii of the Constitution  is the controversy between the parties under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth which Pan has pleaded The judicial power of the Commonwealth is exercised in resolving such matters Here the controversy involves claims under two Acts of the Parliament each of which specifically and independently one of the other confers jurisdiction on this Court Accordingly I am of opinion that this Court does have jurisdiction to hear and determine such an in personam proceeding as this That is not to say however that the ship or property the subject of the writ in rem will be available necessarily to answer any judgment for any in personam claim against a relevant person such as one under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth which is neither a maritime claim or an associated matter within the meaning of ss 4 or 12  I am of opinion that the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth cannot be construed as in any way limiting the jurisdiction of this Court to hear and determine any matter within its jurisdiction Rather appositely to the present proceedings there may be a question at the trial as to the availability of the bank guarantee which Comandate Marine provided as security in lieu of the ship Comandate to satisfy a claim made by Pan which is not within ss 4 or 12 of the Act Pans claim in personam for relief under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth is not invalid and its proceedings in personam are not invalidated by that claim s 51 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 Cth The Court at the final hearing can address any injustice which might arise if Comandate Marine wishes then to agitate such matters including whether the security provided should be available to satisfy any claim under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth The Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth provides Pan with remedies different to any remedy that could be awarded in pursuance of its contract claims Indeed one of the remedies it seeks is the avoidance of the contract not pursuant to contractual principles but by force of an order under s 87 of the Act Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Limited 2004 HCA 3  2004 216 CLR 388 at 409 52  And the High Court has emphasized that the remedies under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth are designed to give effect in cases of contravention of s 52  to the prescribed standards of conduct which are embodied in that section where activities occur in trade or commerce Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited 2000 HCA 12  2000 202 CLR 45 at 83 97  Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree 2005 HCA 69  2005 80 ALJR 183 International trade including the entry into charter parties for vessels is quintessentially within the trade and commerce clause of the Constitution s 51i And par 15 of the amended statement of claim pleads specifically that the relevant conduct occurred in Australia because the communications and representations were received by Mr Colaco in Australia see Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Limited

06_1112.xml,c11,cited,D'Orta Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid [2005] HCA 12 ; (2005) 79 ALJR 755,As noted above Comandate Marines proceedings in rem contained no such request And Art 81 of the Model Law relevantly requires a court in which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement to refer the parties to arbitration if a party so requests no later than when submitting its first statement on the substance of the dispute 59 Russell on Arbitration 22 nd ed at 610 A5018 refers to Art 81 having the same effect as English law ie the party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement must apply to the court without delay for a stay of the proceedings op cit at 296 7005 The position is similar under s 532 of the Commercial Arbitration Act 1984 NSW which applies here by force of s 79 of the Judiciary Act 1903 Cth Comandate Marine did not apply to have its proceedings referred to arbitration when they were before this Court or the High Court I am of opinion that Comandate Marines conduct in bringing its proceedings in rem was incompatible with the arbitration agreement and that Art 81 and Art 9 of the Model Law do not avail it Comandate Marine is in a similar position to that of the landlord in the example given by Parker J in Matthews v Smallwood 1910 1 Ch at 786787 By pleading the writ in the way which it did Comandate Marine exercised a right of action given by the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth to litigate the breach of the charter party as a general maritime claim under s 43f of the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth in this Court I am of opinion that in choosing to claim only that relief when it invoked the jurisdiction of the Court Comandate Marine could not do that without prejudice to any right it might otherwise have had to seek security for the arbitration under s 29 at a later stage It made no such claim in the writ and it procured the arrest of the vessel for the purposes of the particular relief which it claimed in the writ The way in which Comandate Marine framed its claim in the writ nailed its colours to the mast as much as the warrant for arrest later was nailed notionally or actually to the mast of the Boomerang I  Having invoked the jurisdiction of the Court to procure the arrest of the vessel in order to pursue the only claims it pleaded it is not open to Comandate Marine now to say that it did so without prejudice to any right later to apply for security under s 29 of the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth In its report Civil Admiralty Jurisdiction Report No 33 1986 Law Reform Commission Australia the Commission recommended the introduction of what has become s 29 so as to enable the Admiralty jurisdiction to be used to obtain and retain security even though the merits of the dispute are to be determined elsewhere if the subject matter of the dispute lies within Admiralty jurisdiction The Commission noted that such a solution would do most to ensure that the award of the tribunal that decides upon the merits is satisfied and hence that a just result would be obtained It noted that the law had a strong interest in compliance with arbitral awards duly made and in achieving cooperation between courts and arbitrators to this end However the Commission desired in the solution it proposed that the Court should retain a discretion to stay or to exercise jurisdiction to decide the merits ALRC 33 189 That discretion was to arise in the Court being able to take into account all relevant circumstances although the Commission noted that as at 1986 English and South African courts required the plaintiff to demonstrate why the assistance of a court was required in retaining security although there were shades of difference between the readiness of the respective jurisdictions to assist in respect of claims otherwise unconnected with the forum The Tuyuti 1984 QB 838 at 851 Katagum Wholesale Commodities v The MV Paz 1984 3 SAf LR 261 at 268 270 Natal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa Neither party argued that the analysis of the present question should be approached on the basis that there had been a contract of abandonment such as in Paal Wilson  Co AS v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal 1983 1 AC 854 at 915916 There Lord Diplock considered that abandonment of a contract which was still executory involved the formation of a contract of abandonment in which each party promised to release the other from performance of all further obligations including the obligation to pay damages for past breaches arising under the executory and now abandoned contract Lord Brandon of Oakbrook who gave the leading speech see 1983 1 AC 900C per Lord Diplock said that the question of whether a contract has been abandoned or not is one of fact 1983 1 AC at 913F He continued 1983 1 AC at 914AC   The concept of the implied abandonment of a contract as a result of the conduct of the parties to it is well established in law  see Chitty on Contracts  23 rd ed 1968 vol 1 p 577 para 1231 and cases there cited Where A seeks to prove that he and B have abandoned a contract in this way there are two ways in which A can put his case The first way is by showing that the conduct of each party as evinced to the other party and acted on by him leads necessarily to the inference of an implied agreement between them to abandon the contract The second method is by showing that the conduct of B as evinced towards A has been such as to lead A reasonably to believe that B has abandoned the contract even though it has not in fact been Bs intention to do so and that A has significantly altered his position in reliance on that belief The first method involves actual abandonment by both A and B The second method involves the creation by B of a situation in which he is estopped from asserting as against A that he B has not abandoned the contract  Pearl Mill Co v Ivy Tannery Co Ltd 1919 1 KB 78    This contractual analysis is inapposite here but their Lordships approach shows that notwithstanding that arbitration proceedings have been regularly commenced and that both parties are bound to their pursuit the conduct of one party or both parties can bring about the legal consequence that the parties obligations to arbitrate in the arbitration proceedings have become abandoned or inoperative or incapable of being performed In international trade and commerce it is critical that the courts respect and enforce arbitration agreements where they exist in accordance with in particular the New York Convention and legislation designed to give effect to it such as the International Arbitration Act 1974 Cth This is because in international trade and commerce the parties generally will not wish to be subject to serendipity of where a ship may be arrested an action begun or damage occur to determine a forum of any litigation between them or the substantive law to be applied to their dispute The parties will be conscious that an accident or fortuity may occur at any point in a voyage or flight and very different legal results may flow depending on which law and which forum determine their dispute It is for this reason that arbitration clauses such as cl 45b invoking arbitration in London under English law have been a popular recourse for parties in international trade for over a century Nowadays other centres of commercial arbitration including Australia are recognized as providing sound and fair fora and laws for the resolution of disputes in international trade or commerce However the Court should be astute to uphold and enforce agreements such as those in cl 45b rather than to display a form of judicial prejudice or xenophobia against the parties chosen method or place of dispute resolution Refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate in international transactions is capable of undermining the reasonable but significant expectations of the international commercial community and the confidence which it and indeed local business people place in the readiness of courts to hold people to their bargains see eg Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v MV Sky Reefer 515 US 528 at 538 1995 Mitsubishi Motors Corp

which their disputes will be resolved by use of an arbitration agreement such as in cl 45b so they may also choose to give up their rights to use that method or they may so conduct themselves that the choice will be attributed to them by the doctrine of election When Comandate Marine chose to begin its in rem proceedings in the form which it utilized it brought about the consequence that it was taken to have elected not to pursue its arbitration proceedings It may have chosen another method to seek security by framing the relief it sought in its writ in a different way but it did not do so The English authorities on which Comandate Marine relied and to which Sheppard J referred did not consider the question of whether the party seeking security had made an election For that reason I think those authorities are distinguishable Because Comandate Marine elected to litigate the dispute and Pan has too the arbitration agreement in cl 45b has been in substance abandoned or for the purposes of s 75 of the International Arbitration Act 1974 Cth rendered inoperative or incapable of being performed  WAS THERE AN AGREEMENT IN WRITING   Pan argues that Art II r 2 of the New York Convention requires there to be either an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement which is either signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams Pan says that where the contract was formed as it argues the charter party was in this case either by acts or conduct Art II r 2 is not satisfied Pan says that each of the provision of the bank guarantee or the delivery of the vessel was an act or amounted to conduct which brought the contract into existence In support of the argument it relies on decision of the Supreme Court of Italy in Robobar Limited v Finncold SaS 1995 Year Book Comm Arbn XX 739 at 740 The Court held that where a purchase confirmation had been sent by the party seeking to rely on the arbitration clause to which the other party had not responded there was no doubt that none of the formalities in Art II in the New York Convention had been met because the clause was only contained in the confirmation to which the other party had not agreed by letter or telegram Pan also relied on a decision of the Court of Appeal of the Federal Republic of Germany in a case between a Dutch seller and a German buyer 1997 Year Book Comm Arbn Vol II 237 at 238 The Court of Appeal held that a declaration in writing of both sides to the contract was required A one sided confirmation did not suffice and the lack of declaration in writing by the other party could not be cured by that partys appearance in the arbitration In this matter however the critical telex of 20 April 2006 commenced by being in form a confirmation but ended with a request being made to both parties to confirm that the above recap was in line with the negotiations agreed so far The next relevant correspondence was the telex later that day noting that the bank guarantee had been received and indicating when delivery would occur I think this does fall within the positions contemplated by the Supreme Court of Italy and the German Court of Appeal as being ones in which the contract was not formed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams And In Zambia Steel  Building Supplies Ltd v James Clark  Eaton Ltd 1986 2 Lloyds Rep 225 at 234 Ralph Gibson LJ said   It is clear to me that the New York Convention by Art II par 2 did not impose upon the contracting state an obligation to recognise an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration unless it is signed by the parties or unless the agreement is contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams in the sense that the assent to be bound by both parties is given in writing by such document    The Manitoba Court of Appeal noted in Proctor v Schellenberg 2003 2 WWR 621 at 628 18 that Art IV r 1b of the New York Convention requires a party seeking to obtain recognition and enforcement of an award to provide the original agreement referred to in article II or a duly certified copy thereof They said that  there had to be a record to evidence the agreement of the parties to resolve the dispute by arbitral process in concluding that facsimile transmissions were sufficient to be or form part of an agreement in writing In AJ van den Bergs The New York Arbitration Convention of 1958 1981 at 196198 206 277 the learned author notes that Art II r 2 excludes oral or tacit acceptance and concluded at 197 227 that as at 1981 there had been only one  exception to the unanimous judicial affirmation that tacit acceptance does not comply with Art II r 2 that being a decision of the Court of First Instance of Rotterdam The learned author said that this decision was not in conformity with either the text of Art II r 2 or the intent of its drafters and noted that the decision had been rightly criticised Significantly he referred to the history of Art II r 2 which confirmed that the drafters of the New York Convention wished to exclude from its scope oral or tacit acceptance of a written proposal to arbitrate In his article Is the need for writing as expressed in the New York Convention and the Model Law out of step with commercial practice   1996 International Arbitration vol 12 no 1 p 27 at 32 Neil Kaplan QC affirmed Prof van den Bergs interpretation Mr Kaplan referred

Limited v Goldroyce Garment Limited 1994 2 HKC 526 HCMP000 9081994 that there was no basis for arguing that an arbitration agreement could be established by a course of dealing or the conduct of the parties under Art VII of the Model Law see Schedule 2 to the International Arbitration Act 1974 Cth Kaplan J said that he had looked at the UNCITRAL reports in relation to Art VII and was quite satisfied that it could not be complied with unless there was a record in which the defendant in writing assented to the agreement to arbitrate see at 12 It has been recognized that a national courts in the interest of uniformity should construe rules formulated by an international convention especially rules formulated for the purpose of governing international transactions such as the hire of vessels or the carriage of goods in a normal manner appropriate for the interpretation of an international convention unconstrained by technical rules of English or domestic law or by English or domestic legal precedent but on broad principles of general acceptation Shipping Corporation of India Ltd v Gamlen Chemical Co Australasia Pty Ltd 1980 HCA 51  1980 147 CLR 142 at 159 per Mason and

537 1995 per Kennedy J Renquist CJ Scalia Souter Thomas and Ginsberg JJ agreeing Mason and Wilson JJ went on to say 147 CLR at 159   It is important that we should adhere to this approach when we are interpreting rules which have been formulated for the purpose of regulating the rights and liabilities of parties to international mercantile transactions where great store is set upon certainty and uniformity of application see too Great China Metal Industries Ltd v Malayasian International Shipping Corporation Berhad 1998 HCA 65  1988 196 CLR 161 at 186 71 per McHugh J   It is also important in construing international conventions that the views taken by courts particularly the Supreme Courts of nations are kept in mind so that there can be consistency in interpretation And I am conscious that in s 31 of the International Arbitration Act 1974 Cth the definition of arbitration agreement is that it is an agreement of the kind referred to in Art II r 2 As a matter of construction under Australian law I would have no hesitation in concluding that the definition was inclusive one However I think that the drafting of the definition in Art II r 2 invokes a concept of certainty that the arbitration clause or arbitration agreement is itself signed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams The precontractual exchanges of telexes and emails cannot themselves convert into separate or freestanding agreements in the present case unless and until the vessel was actually agreed to be fixed It was only upon the agreement to fix the vessel that it could be said to be under charter And as Capt Piperakis said he had imposed an absolute condition that a bank guarantee be provided The owners were not prepared to deliver the vessel on the evidence before me unless and until the bank guarantee had been received and it was at that point that they agreed that they were contractually bound That agreement which thus brought cl 45b into existence as an agreement to arbitrate was manifested by Comandate Marines conduct either in accepting the bank guarantee or later delivering the vessel At common law a recap telex can be found to contain a charter party including an arbitration clause which is incorporated by reference to an earlier telex or other communication even though both parties have not executed it The Epsilon Rosa 2003 2 Lloyds Rep 509 at 514 21 per Tuckey LJ May and Brooke LJJ agreeing But as Tuckey LJ pointed out 2003 2 Lloyds Rep at 515 29 one cannot generalize in these cases The act of acceptance which formed the contract was the provision of the bank guarantee And it is common ground that a formal charter party incorporating all of the agreed terms was to be prepared later by Prime on behalf of Comandate Marine Both parties were under a duty to cooperate to bring about the final form of their agreement in writing  Secured Income Real Estate Australia Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Limited 1979 HCA 51  1979 144 CLR 596 at 607 per Mason J applying Butt v MDonald 1896 7 QLJ 68 at 7071 per Griffith CJ No doubt cl 45b was part of the agreement between Pan and Comandate Marine But that does not of itself comply with Art II r 2 Rather the critical part of the conduct by which the contract was formed was the provision by a third party of the bank guarantee which brought the contract into existence So the contract being or including the arbitration agreement was not made by being signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of telexes or emails The contract included the conduct of the provision of the bank guarantee which fell outside the scope of Art II r 2 And because there is no evidence of any further written communication relied on as amounting to a document capable of being part of an exchange of letters or telegrams including telexes or emails then this series of communications does not satisfy the requirements of Art II r 2 A contract can be made by conduct evidencing a manifestation of assent to an offer Empirnall Holdings Pty Limited v Machon Paull Partners Pty Limited 1988 14 NSWLR 523 at 534535 per McHugh JA Samuels JA agreeing at 531 Accordingly I am of opinion that the telex from Prime to Mr Colaco headed FINAL RECAP was an offer by Comandate Marine to charter the vessel on the terms there set out and incorporated by reference which was capable of acceptance only by the provision of the bank guarantee For the reasons I have given based on the fairly settled interpretation of Art II r 2 that tacit acceptance is insufficient on the evidence I find that at the present time there is no agreement in writing for the purposes of Art II r 2 of the New York Convention  COMANDATE MARINES ALTERNATIVE CLAIM FOR STAY UNDER S 53 OF THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION ACT 1984 NSW   Comandate Marine argued that if an agreement in writing for the purposes of s 72 of the International Arbitration Act 1974 Cth were not found I should grant a stay pursuant to s 53 of the Commercial Arbitration Act 1984 NSW The Commercial Arbitration Act 1984 NSW provides that an arbitration agreement  means an agreement in writing to refer present or future disputes to arbitration see s 41 By s 531 the Court may stay the proceedings if it is satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration in accordance with the agreement and that the applicant was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration Having regard to the fact that Comandate Marine commenced its proceedings in rem as I have found without seeking to enforce any claim to arbitrate in those proceedings I am of opinion that the evidence establishes that Comandate Marine was not then ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration However its application for stay is made in Pans proceedings At the time when Pans proceedings were commenced Comandate Marine was pursuing the arbitration proceedings and still seeks to do so now I do not think that makes the commencement of the proceedings in rem irrelevant By s 532  the leave of the Court is required in the proceedings which have been commenced where the applicant for stay has delivered pleadings or taken any other steps in the proceedings other than the entry of an appearance Although Comandate Marines proceedings in rem were in separate proceedings they form as I have held part of the same matter for the purposes of ss 75 and 76 of the Constitution  and I am not minded to exercise any discretion in favour of Comandate Marine having regard to its conduct in taking the in rem proceedings in the circumstances which I have found  SCOPE OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE   Comandate Marine argued that the claims brought under ss 51A  52 and 55A of the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth and seeking relief under ss 82 and 87  including relief setting aside ab initio the charter party and preventing Comandate Marine from enforcing against the plaintiff any arbitral award were colourable It was not put that the claims were an abuse of the process of the Court Rather it was put in oral argument that there had been a misuse of s 12 of the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth because the very complaints the subject of the claims under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth were in essence the same as the breaches of contract relied on by Pan Comandate Marine in written submissions asserted that the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth claims had been made for the improper purpose of fabricating jurisdiction I do not think this argument has any substance Part V of the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth in which s 52 is found sets out a statutory norm of conduct to which corporations must conform in trade or commerce The task of the Court is to apply such norms where they arise in litigation even where the outcome is not materially different to applying the common law of negligence as in Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree 2005 HCA 69  2005 80 ALJR 183 at 191 29 per Gleeson CJ or of passing off as in Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd 2000 HCA 12  2000 202 CLR 45 at 83 97  In the latter case the whole court approved what Mason J had said in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd 1982 HCA 44  1982 149 CLR 191 at 205 see 202 CLR at 83 97 in the following terms   Likewise the operation of s 52 is not restricted by the common law principles relating to passingoff If as I consider the section provides the public with wider protection from deception than the common law it does not follow that there is a conflict between the section and the common law The statute provides an additional remedy  emphasis added   I am of opinion that the statutory remedy relied on by Pan is additional to whatever contractual remedies may be available to it and that there is no basis for the attribution to Pan of any improper purpose to fabricate jurisdiction The Parliament of the Commonwealth has enacted the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth under the trade and commerce power in s 51i of the Constitution  There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Pan has not properly and regularly invoked the Courts jurisdiction Pans pleading raises an issue of substance as to whether or not Comandate Marine engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct I am satisfied that this is truly part of the one controversy which the Court has been asked to quell cf DOrta Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid 2005 HCA 12  2005 79 ALJR 755 at 761 32  The only arguable limitation in the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth which might be seen as restricting the jurisdiction or powers any court invested with jurisdiction under that Act is to be found in s 13 But on examination s 13 does not affect the jurisdiction which a court including this Court has from sources other than the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth itself Rather s 13 provides that the Act does not confer on or invest jurisdiction on or in a court in a matter which is not of a kind mentioned in ss 76ii or iii of the Constitution  In ascertaining the scope of jurisdiction which the Federal Court may exercise s 13 thus provides some guidance It contemplates that matters of a kind mentioned in ss 76ii and iii of the Constitution can be within the jurisdiction of the Court Section 76iii of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction is a clear source of power to enact the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth itself and define maritime claims as well as associated matters of Admiralty and marine jurisdiction in ss 4 and 12  And s 76ii provides that the judicial power of the Commonwealth is invoked in any matter arising under any laws made by the Parliament The purpose of s 13 is to limit in the construction of the Act the conferral of jurisdiction by the Act to matters within the power of the Parliament and the judicial power of the Commonwealth It is not to limit the other powers of a court on or in which the Act confers or invests jurisdiction Clearly enough s 86 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth is a law made by the Parliament which confers jurisdiction on this Court independently of the jurisdiction conferred on it by the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth It is quite inappropriate to read provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court by making implications or imposing limitations which are not found in the express words Owners of Shin Kobe Maru v Empire Shipping Co Inc 1994 HCA 54  1994 181 CLR 404 at 421 see too Mansfield v Director of Public Prosecutions for

and Crennan JJ see too Elbe Shipping SA v The Ship Global Peace 2006 FCA 954 at 138 per Allsop J see too at 6276 Comandate Marine also argued that a limitation was imposed on courts exercising jurisdiction conferred by the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth by s 31 But s 311 provides that the liability on a judgment of a relevant person defined by s 31 as a person who would be liable were the proceedings in personam brought against that person who has entered an appearance in a proceeding on a maritime claim commenced as an action in rem against a ship or property is not limited to the value of the ship or other property The section confirms the amplitude of the jurisdiction rather than restricts it Next Comandate Marine argued that a relevant person who appears in proceedings commenced by a writ in rem cannot be sued in proceedings in personam in this Court in respect of matters outside the relief claimed in the writ in rem on a cause of action other than a maritime claim within the meaning of s 4 of the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth or on associated matters of admiralty and marine jurisdiction within the meaning of s 12 of that Act Here part of the matter within the meaning of ss 76ii and iii of the Constitution  is the controversy between the parties under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth which Pan has pleaded The judicial power of the Commonwealth is exercised in resolving such matters Here the controversy involves claims under two Acts of the Parliament each of which specifically and independently one of the other confers jurisdiction on this Court Accordingly I am of opinion that this Court does have jurisdiction to hear and determine such an in personam proceeding as this That is not to say however that the ship or property the subject of the writ in rem will be available necessarily to answer any judgment for any in personam claim against a relevant person such as one under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth which is neither a maritime claim or an associated matter within the meaning of ss 4 or 12  I am of opinion that the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth cannot be construed as in any way limiting the jurisdiction of this Court to hear and determine any matter within its jurisdiction Rather appositely to the present proceedings there may be a question at the trial as to the availability of the bank guarantee which Comandate Marine provided as security in lieu of the ship Comandate to satisfy a claim made by Pan which is not within ss 4 or 12 of the Act Pans claim in personam for relief under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth is not invalid and its proceedings in personam are not invalidated by that claim s 51 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 Cth The Court at the final hearing can address any injustice which might arise if Comandate Marine wishes then to agitate such matters including whether the security provided should be available to satisfy any claim under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth The Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth provides Pan with remedies different to any remedy that could be awarded in pursuance of its contract claims Indeed one of the remedies it seeks is the avoidance of the contract not pursuant to contractual principles but by force of an order under s 87 of the Act Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Limited 2004 HCA 3  2004 216 CLR 388 at 409 52  And the High Court has emphasized that the remedies under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth are designed to give effect in cases of contravention of s 52  to the prescribed standards of conduct which are embodied in that section where activities occur in trade or commerce Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited 2000 HCA 12  2000 202 CLR 45 at 83 97  Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree 2005 HCA 69  2005 80 ALJR 183 International trade including the entry into charter parties for vessels is quintessentially within the trade and commerce clause of the Constitution s 51i And par 15 of the amended statement of claim pleads specifically that the relevant conduct occurred in Australia because the communications and representations were received by Mr Colaco in Australia see Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Limited

06_1112.xml,c12,cited,Elbe Shipping SA v The Ship 'Global Peace' [2006] FCA 954,As noted above Comandate Marines proceedings in rem contained no such request And Art 81 of the Model Law relevantly requires a court in which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement to refer the parties to arbitration if a party so requests no later than when submitting its first statement on the substance of the dispute 59 Russell on Arbitration 22 nd ed at 610 A5018 refers to Art 81 having the same effect as English law ie the party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement must apply to the court without delay for a stay of the proceedings op cit at 296 7005 The position is similar under s 532 of the Commercial Arbitration Act 1984 NSW which applies here by force of s 79 of the Judiciary Act 1903 Cth Comandate Marine did not apply to have its proceedings referred to arbitration when they were before this Court or the High Court I am of opinion that Comandate Marines conduct in bringing its proceedings in rem was incompatible with the arbitration agreement and that Art 81 and Art 9 of the Model Law do not avail it Comandate Marine is in a similar position to that of the landlord in the example given by Parker J in Matthews v Smallwood 1910 1 Ch at 786787 By pleading the writ in the way which it did Comandate Marine exercised a right of action given by the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth to litigate the breach of the charter party as a general maritime claim under s 43f of the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth in this Court I am of opinion that in choosing to claim only that relief when it invoked the jurisdiction of the Court Comandate Marine could not do that without prejudice to any right it might otherwise have had to seek security for the arbitration under s 29 at a later stage It made no such claim in the writ and it procured the arrest of the vessel for the purposes of the particular relief which it claimed in the writ The way in which Comandate Marine framed its claim in the writ nailed its colours to the mast as much as the warrant for arrest later was nailed notionally or actually to the mast of the Boomerang I  Having invoked the jurisdiction of the Court to procure the arrest of the vessel in order to pursue the only claims it pleaded it is not open to Comandate Marine now to say that it did so without prejudice to any right later to apply for security under s 29 of the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth In its report Civil Admiralty Jurisdiction Report No 33 1986 Law Reform Commission Australia the Commission recommended the introduction of what has become s 29 so as to enable the Admiralty jurisdiction to be used to obtain and retain security even though the merits of the dispute are to be determined elsewhere if the subject matter of the dispute lies within Admiralty jurisdiction The Commission noted that such a solution would do most to ensure that the award of the tribunal that decides upon the merits is satisfied and hence that a just result would be obtained It noted that the law had a strong interest in compliance with arbitral awards duly made and in achieving cooperation between courts and arbitrators to this end However the Commission desired in the solution it proposed that the Court should retain a discretion to stay or to exercise jurisdiction to decide the merits ALRC 33 189 That discretion was to arise in the Court being able to take into account all relevant circumstances although the Commission noted that as at 1986 English and South African courts required the plaintiff to demonstrate why the assistance of a court was required in retaining security although there were shades of difference between the readiness of the respective jurisdictions to assist in respect of claims otherwise unconnected with the forum The Tuyuti 1984 QB 838 at 851 Katagum Wholesale Commodities v The MV Paz 1984 3 SAf LR 261 at 268 270 Natal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa Neither party argued that the analysis of the present question should be approached on the basis that there had been a contract of abandonment such as in Paal Wilson  Co AS v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal 1983 1 AC 854 at 915916 There Lord Diplock considered that abandonment of a contract which was still executory involved the formation of a contract of abandonment in which each party promised to release the other from performance of all further obligations including the obligation to pay damages for past breaches arising under the executory and now abandoned contract Lord Brandon of Oakbrook who gave the leading speech see 1983 1 AC 900C per Lord Diplock said that the question of whether a contract has been abandoned or not is one of fact 1983 1 AC at 913F He continued 1983 1 AC at 914AC   The concept of the implied abandonment of a contract as a result of the conduct of the parties to it is well established in law  see Chitty on Contracts  23 rd ed 1968 vol 1 p 577 para 1231 and cases there cited Where A seeks to prove that he and B have abandoned a contract in this way there are two ways in which A can put his case The first way is by showing that the conduct of each party as evinced to the other party and acted on by him leads necessarily to the inference of an implied agreement between them to abandon the contract The second method is by showing that the conduct of B as evinced towards A has been such as to lead A reasonably to believe that B has abandoned the contract even though it has not in fact been Bs intention to do so and that A has significantly altered his position in reliance on that belief The first method involves actual abandonment by both A and B The second method involves the creation by B of a situation in which he is estopped from asserting as against A that he B has not abandoned the contract  Pearl Mill Co v Ivy Tannery Co Ltd 1919 1 KB 78    This contractual analysis is inapposite here but their Lordships approach shows that notwithstanding that arbitration proceedings have been regularly commenced and that both parties are bound to their pursuit the conduct of one party or both parties can bring about the legal consequence that the parties obligations to arbitrate in the arbitration proceedings have become abandoned or inoperative or incapable of being performed In international trade and commerce it is critical that the courts respect and enforce arbitration agreements where they exist in accordance with in particular the New York Convention and legislation designed to give effect to it such as the International Arbitration Act 1974 Cth This is because in international trade and commerce the parties generally will not wish to be subject to serendipity of where a ship may be arrested an action begun or damage occur to determine a forum of any litigation between them or the substantive law to be applied to their dispute The parties will be conscious that an accident or fortuity may occur at any point in a voyage or flight and very different legal results may flow depending on which law and which forum determine their dispute It is for this reason that arbitration clauses such as cl 45b invoking arbitration in London under English law have been a popular recourse for parties in international trade for over a century Nowadays other centres of commercial arbitration including Australia are recognized as providing sound and fair fora and laws for the resolution of disputes in international trade or commerce However the Court should be astute to uphold and enforce agreements such as those in cl 45b rather than to display a form of judicial prejudice or xenophobia against the parties chosen method or place of dispute resolution Refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate in international transactions is capable of undermining the reasonable but significant expectations of the international commercial community and the confidence which it and indeed local business people place in the readiness of courts to hold people to their bargains see eg Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v MV Sky Reefer 515 US 528 at 538 1995 Mitsubishi Motors Corp

which their disputes will be resolved by use of an arbitration agreement such as in cl 45b so they may also choose to give up their rights to use that method or they may so conduct themselves that the choice will be attributed to them by the doctrine of election When Comandate Marine chose to begin its in rem proceedings in the form which it utilized it brought about the consequence that it was taken to have elected not to pursue its arbitration proceedings It may have chosen another method to seek security by framing the relief it sought in its writ in a different way but it did not do so The English authorities on which Comandate Marine relied and to which Sheppard J referred did not consider the question of whether the party seeking security had made an election For that reason I think those authorities are distinguishable Because Comandate Marine elected to litigate the dispute and Pan has too the arbitration agreement in cl 45b has been in substance abandoned or for the purposes of s 75 of the International Arbitration Act 1974 Cth rendered inoperative or incapable of being performed  WAS THERE AN AGREEMENT IN WRITING   Pan argues that Art II r 2 of the New York Convention requires there to be either an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement which is either signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams Pan says that where the contract was formed as it argues the charter party was in this case either by acts or conduct Art II r 2 is not satisfied Pan says that each of the provision of the bank guarantee or the delivery of the vessel was an act or amounted to conduct which brought the contract into existence In support of the argument it relies on decision of the Supreme Court of Italy in Robobar Limited v Finncold SaS 1995 Year Book Comm Arbn XX 739 at 740 The Court held that where a purchase confirmation had been sent by the party seeking to rely on the arbitration clause to which the other party had not responded there was no doubt that none of the formalities in Art II in the New York Convention had been met because the clause was only contained in the confirmation to which the other party had not agreed by letter or telegram Pan also relied on a decision of the Court of Appeal of the Federal Republic of Germany in a case between a Dutch seller and a German buyer 1997 Year Book Comm Arbn Vol II 237 at 238 The Court of Appeal held that a declaration in writing of both sides to the contract was required A one sided confirmation did not suffice and the lack of declaration in writing by the other party could not be cured by that partys appearance in the arbitration In this matter however the critical telex of 20 April 2006 commenced by being in form a confirmation but ended with a request being made to both parties to confirm that the above recap was in line with the negotiations agreed so far The next relevant correspondence was the telex later that day noting that the bank guarantee had been received and indicating when delivery would occur I think this does fall within the positions contemplated by the Supreme Court of Italy and the German Court of Appeal as being ones in which the contract was not formed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams And In Zambia Steel  Building Supplies Ltd v James Clark  Eaton Ltd 1986 2 Lloyds Rep 225 at 234 Ralph Gibson LJ said   It is clear to me that the New York Convention by Art II par 2 did not impose upon the contracting state an obligation to recognise an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration unless it is signed by the parties or unless the agreement is contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams in the sense that the assent to be bound by both parties is given in writing by such document    The Manitoba Court of Appeal noted in Proctor v Schellenberg 2003 2 WWR 621 at 628 18 that Art IV r 1b of the New York Convention requires a party seeking to obtain recognition and enforcement of an award to provide the original agreement referred to in article II or a duly certified copy thereof They said that  there had to be a record to evidence the agreement of the parties to resolve the dispute by arbitral process in concluding that facsimile transmissions were sufficient to be or form part of an agreement in writing In AJ van den Bergs The New York Arbitration Convention of 1958 1981 at 196198 206 277 the learned author notes that Art II r 2 excludes oral or tacit acceptance and concluded at 197 227 that as at 1981 there had been only one  exception to the unanimous judicial affirmation that tacit acceptance does not comply with Art II r 2 that being a decision of the Court of First Instance of Rotterdam The learned author said that this decision was not in conformity with either the text of Art II r 2 or the intent of its drafters and noted that the decision had been rightly criticised Significantly he referred to the history of Art II r 2 which confirmed that the drafters of the New York Convention wished to exclude from its scope oral or tacit acceptance of a written proposal to arbitrate In his article Is the need for writing as expressed in the New York Convention and the Model Law out of step with commercial practice   1996 International Arbitration vol 12 no 1 p 27 at 32 Neil Kaplan QC affirmed Prof van den Bergs interpretation Mr Kaplan referred

Limited v Goldroyce Garment Limited 1994 2 HKC 526 HCMP000 9081994 that there was no basis for arguing that an arbitration agreement could be established by a course of dealing or the conduct of the parties under Art VII of the Model Law see Schedule 2 to the International Arbitration Act 1974 Cth Kaplan J said that he had looked at the UNCITRAL reports in relation to Art VII and was quite satisfied that it could not be complied with unless there was a record in which the defendant in writing assented to the agreement to arbitrate see at 12 It has been recognized that a national courts in the interest of uniformity should construe rules formulated by an international convention especially rules formulated for the purpose of governing international transactions such as the hire of vessels or the carriage of goods in a normal manner appropriate for the interpretation of an international convention unconstrained by technical rules of English or domestic law or by English or domestic legal precedent but on broad principles of general acceptation Shipping Corporation of India Ltd v Gamlen Chemical Co Australasia Pty Ltd 1980 HCA 51  1980 147 CLR 142 at 159 per Mason and

537 1995 per Kennedy J Renquist CJ Scalia Souter Thomas and Ginsberg JJ agreeing Mason and Wilson JJ went on to say 147 CLR at 159   It is important that we should adhere to this approach when we are interpreting rules which have been formulated for the purpose of regulating the rights and liabilities of parties to international mercantile transactions where great store is set upon certainty and uniformity of application see too Great China Metal Industries Ltd v Malayasian International Shipping Corporation Berhad 1998 HCA 65  1988 196 CLR 161 at 186 71 per McHugh J   It is also important in construing international conventions that the views taken by courts particularly the Supreme Courts of nations are kept in mind so that there can be consistency in interpretation And I am conscious that in s 31 of the International Arbitration Act 1974 Cth the definition of arbitration agreement is that it is an agreement of the kind referred to in Art II r 2 As a matter of construction under Australian law I would have no hesitation in concluding that the definition was inclusive one However I think that the drafting of the definition in Art II r 2 invokes a concept of certainty that the arbitration clause or arbitration agreement is itself signed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams The precontractual exchanges of telexes and emails cannot themselves convert into separate or freestanding agreements in the present case unless and until the vessel was actually agreed to be fixed It was only upon the agreement to fix the vessel that it could be said to be under charter And as Capt Piperakis said he had imposed an absolute condition that a bank guarantee be provided The owners were not prepared to deliver the vessel on the evidence before me unless and until the bank guarantee had been received and it was at that point that they agreed that they were contractually bound That agreement which thus brought cl 45b into existence as an agreement to arbitrate was manifested by Comandate Marines conduct either in accepting the bank guarantee or later delivering the vessel At common law a recap telex can be found to contain a charter party including an arbitration clause which is incorporated by reference to an earlier telex or other communication even though both parties have not executed it The Epsilon Rosa 2003 2 Lloyds Rep 509 at 514 21 per Tuckey LJ May and Brooke LJJ agreeing But as Tuckey LJ pointed out 2003 2 Lloyds Rep at 515 29 one cannot generalize in these cases The act of acceptance which formed the contract was the provision of the bank guarantee And it is common ground that a formal charter party incorporating all of the agreed terms was to be prepared later by Prime on behalf of Comandate Marine Both parties were under a duty to cooperate to bring about the final form of their agreement in writing  Secured Income Real Estate Australia Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Limited 1979 HCA 51  1979 144 CLR 596 at 607 per Mason J applying Butt v MDonald 1896 7 QLJ 68 at 7071 per Griffith CJ No doubt cl 45b was part of the agreement between Pan and Comandate Marine But that does not of itself comply with Art II r 2 Rather the critical part of the conduct by which the contract was formed was the provision by a third party of the bank guarantee which brought the contract into existence So the contract being or including the arbitration agreement was not made by being signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of telexes or emails The contract included the conduct of the provision of the bank guarantee which fell outside the scope of Art II r 2 And because there is no evidence of any further written communication relied on as amounting to a document capable of being part of an exchange of letters or telegrams including telexes or emails then this series of communications does not satisfy the requirements of Art II r 2 A contract can be made by conduct evidencing a manifestation of assent to an offer Empirnall Holdings Pty Limited v Machon Paull Partners Pty Limited 1988 14 NSWLR 523 at 534535 per McHugh JA Samuels JA agreeing at 531 Accordingly I am of opinion that the telex from Prime to Mr Colaco headed FINAL RECAP was an offer by Comandate Marine to charter the vessel on the terms there set out and incorporated by reference which was capable of acceptance only by the provision of the bank guarantee For the reasons I have given based on the fairly settled interpretation of Art II r 2 that tacit acceptance is insufficient on the evidence I find that at the present time there is no agreement in writing for the purposes of Art II r 2 of the New York Convention  COMANDATE MARINES ALTERNATIVE CLAIM FOR STAY UNDER S 53 OF THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION ACT 1984 NSW   Comandate Marine argued that if an agreement in writing for the purposes of s 72 of the International Arbitration Act 1974 Cth were not found I should grant a stay pursuant to s 53 of the Commercial Arbitration Act 1984 NSW The Commercial Arbitration Act 1984 NSW provides that an arbitration agreement  means an agreement in writing to refer present or future disputes to arbitration see s 41 By s 531 the Court may stay the proceedings if it is satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration in accordance with the agreement and that the applicant was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration Having regard to the fact that Comandate Marine commenced its proceedings in rem as I have found without seeking to enforce any claim to arbitrate in those proceedings I am of opinion that the evidence establishes that Comandate Marine was not then ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration However its application for stay is made in Pans proceedings At the time when Pans proceedings were commenced Comandate Marine was pursuing the arbitration proceedings and still seeks to do so now I do not think that makes the commencement of the proceedings in rem irrelevant By s 532  the leave of the Court is required in the proceedings which have been commenced where the applicant for stay has delivered pleadings or taken any other steps in the proceedings other than the entry of an appearance Although Comandate Marines proceedings in rem were in separate proceedings they form as I have held part of the same matter for the purposes of ss 75 and 76 of the Constitution  and I am not minded to exercise any discretion in favour of Comandate Marine having regard to its conduct in taking the in rem proceedings in the circumstances which I have found  SCOPE OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE   Comandate Marine argued that the claims brought under ss 51A  52 and 55A of the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth and seeking relief under ss 82 and 87  including relief setting aside ab initio the charter party and preventing Comandate Marine from enforcing against the plaintiff any arbitral award were colourable It was not put that the claims were an abuse of the process of the Court Rather it was put in oral argument that there had been a misuse of s 12 of the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth because the very complaints the subject of the claims under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth were in essence the same as the breaches of contract relied on by Pan Comandate Marine in written submissions asserted that the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth claims had been made for the improper purpose of fabricating jurisdiction I do not think this argument has any substance Part V of the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth in which s 52 is found sets out a statutory norm of conduct to which corporations must conform in trade or commerce The task of the Court is to apply such norms where they arise in litigation even where the outcome is not materially different to applying the common law of negligence as in Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree 2005 HCA 69  2005 80 ALJR 183 at 191 29 per Gleeson CJ or of passing off as in Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd 2000 HCA 12

at 83 97 in the following terms   Likewise the operation of s 52 is not restricted by the common law principles relating to passingoff If as I consider the section provides the public with wider protection from deception than the common law it does not follow that there is a conflict between the section and the common law The statute provides an additional remedy  emphasis added   I am of opinion that the statutory remedy relied on by Pan is additional to whatever contractual remedies may be available to it and that there is no basis for the attribution to Pan of any improper purpose to fabricate jurisdiction The Parliament of the Commonwealth has enacted the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth under the trade and commerce power in s 51i of the Constitution  There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Pan has not properly and regularly invoked the Courts jurisdiction Pans pleading raises an issue of substance as to whether or not Comandate Marine engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct I am satisfied that this is truly part of the one controversy which the Court has been asked to quell cf DOrta Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid 2005 HCA 12  2005 79 ALJR 755 at 761 32  The only arguable limitation in the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth which might be seen as restricting the jurisdiction or powers any court invested with jurisdiction under that Act is to be found in s 13 But on examination s 13 does not affect the jurisdiction which a court including this Court has from sources other than the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth itself Rather s 13 provides that the Act does not confer on or invest jurisdiction on or in a court in a matter which is not of a kind mentioned in ss 76ii or iii of the Constitution  In ascertaining the scope of jurisdiction which the Federal Court may exercise s 13 thus provides some guidance It contemplates that matters of a kind mentioned in ss 76ii and iii of the Constitution can be within the jurisdiction of the Court Section 76iii of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction is a clear source of power to enact the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth itself and define maritime claims as well as associated matters of Admiralty and marine jurisdiction in ss 4 and 12  And s 76ii provides that the judicial power of the Commonwealth is invoked in any matter arising under any laws made by the Parliament The purpose of s 13 is to limit in the construction of the Act the conferral of jurisdiction by the Act to matters within the power of the Parliament and the judicial power of the Commonwealth It is not to limit the other powers of a court on or in which the Act confers or invests jurisdiction Clearly enough s 86 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth is a law made by the Parliament which confers jurisdiction on this Court independently of the jurisdiction conferred on it by the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth It is quite inappropriate to read provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court by making implications or imposing

jurisdiction conferred by the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth by s 31 But s 311 provides that the liability on a judgment of a relevant person defined by s 31 as a person who would be liable were the proceedings in personam brought against that person who has entered an appearance in a proceeding on a maritime claim commenced as an action in rem against a ship or property is not limited to the value of the ship or other property The section confirms the amplitude of the jurisdiction rather than restricts it Next Comandate Marine argued that a relevant person who appears in proceedings commenced by a writ in rem cannot be sued in proceedings in personam in this Court in respect of matters outside the relief claimed in the writ in rem on a cause of action other than a maritime claim within the meaning of s 4 of the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth or on associated matters of admiralty and marine jurisdiction within the meaning of s 12 of that Act Here part of the matter within the meaning of ss 76ii and iii of the Constitution  is the controversy between the parties under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth which Pan has pleaded The judicial power of the Commonwealth is exercised in resolving such matters Here the controversy involves claims under two Acts of the Parliament each of which specifically and independently one of the other confers jurisdiction on this Court Accordingly I am of opinion that this Court does have jurisdiction to hear and determine such an in personam proceeding as this That is not to say however that the ship or property the subject of the writ in rem will be available necessarily to answer any judgment for any in personam claim against a relevant person such as one under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth which is neither a maritime claim or an associated matter within the meaning of ss 4 or 12  I am of opinion that the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth cannot be construed as in any way limiting the jurisdiction of this Court to hear and determine any matter within its jurisdiction Rather appositely to the present proceedings there may be a question at the trial as to the availability of the bank guarantee which Comandate Marine provided as security in lieu of the ship Comandate to satisfy a claim made by Pan which is not within ss 4 or 12 of the Act Pans claim in personam for relief under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth is not invalid and its proceedings in personam are not invalidated by that claim s 51 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 Cth The Court at the final hearing can address any injustice which might arise if Comandate Marine wishes then to agitate such matters including whether the security provided should be available to satisfy any claim under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth The Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth provides Pan with remedies different to any remedy that could be awarded in pursuance of its contract claims Indeed one of the remedies it seeks is the avoidance of the contract not pursuant to contractual principles but by force of an order under s 87 of the Act Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Limited 2004 HCA 3  2004 216 CLR 388 at 409 52  And the High Court has emphasized that the remedies under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth are designed to give effect in cases of contravention of s 52  to the prescribed standards of conduct which are embodied in that section where activities occur in trade or commerce Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited 2000 HCA 12  2000 202 CLR 45 at 83 97  Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree 2005 HCA 69  2005 80 ALJR 183 International trade including the entry into charter parties for vessels is quintessentially within the trade and commerce clause of the Constitution s 51i And par 15 of the amended statement of claim

of the Model Law relevantly requires a court in which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement to refer the parties to arbitration if a party so requests no later than when submitting its first statement on the substance of the dispute 59 Russell on Arbitration 22 nd ed at 610 A5018 refers to Art 81 having the same effect as English law ie the party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement must apply to the court without delay for a stay of the proceedings op cit at 296 7005 The position is similar under s 532 of the Commercial Arbitration Act 1984 NSW which applies here by force of s 79 of the Judiciary Act 1903 Cth Comandate Marine did not apply to have its proceedings referred to arbitration when they were before this Court or the High Court I am of opinion that Comandate Marines conduct in bringing its proceedings in rem was incompatible with the arbitration agreement and that Art 81 and Art 9 of the Model Law do not avail it Comandate Marine is in a similar position to that of the landlord in the example given by Parker J in Matthews v Smallwood 1910 1 Ch at 786787 By pleading the writ in the way which it did Comandate Marine exercised a right of action given by the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth to litigate the breach of the charter party as a general maritime claim under s 43f of the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth in this Court I am of opinion that in choosing to claim only that relief when it invoked the jurisdiction of the Court Comandate Marine could not do that without prejudice to any right it might otherwise have had to seek security for the arbitration under s 29 at a later stage It made no such claim in the writ and it procured the arrest of the vessel for the purposes of the particular relief which it claimed in the writ The way in which Comandate Marine framed its claim in the writ nailed its colours to the mast as much as the warrant for arrest later was nailed notionally or actually to the mast of the Boomerang I  Having invoked the jurisdiction of the Court to procure the arrest of the vessel in order to pursue the only claims it pleaded it is not open to Comandate Marine now to say that it did so without prejudice to any right later to apply for security under s 29 of the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth In its report Civil Admiralty Jurisdiction Report No 33 1986 Law Reform Commission Australia the Commission recommended the introduction of what has become s 29 so as to enable the Admiralty jurisdiction to be used to obtain and retain security even though the merits of the dispute are to be determined elsewhere if the subject matter of the dispute lies within Admiralty jurisdiction The Commission noted that such a solution would do most to ensure that the award of the tribunal that decides upon the merits is satisfied and hence that a just result would be obtained It noted that the law had a strong interest in compliance with arbitral awards duly made and in achieving cooperation between courts and arbitrators to this end However the Commission desired in the solution it proposed that the Court should retain a discretion to stay or to exercise jurisdiction to decide the merits ALRC 33 189 That discretion was to arise in the Court being able to take into account all relevant circumstances although the Commission noted that as at 1986 English and South African courts required the plaintiff to demonstrate why the assistance of a court was required in retaining security although there were shades of difference between the readiness of the respective jurisdictions to assist in respect of claims otherwise unconnected with the forum The Tuyuti 1984 QB 838 at 851 Katagum Wholesale Commodities v The MV Paz 1984 3 SAf LR 261 at 268 270 Natal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa Neither party argued that the analysis of the present question should be approached on the basis that there had been a contract of abandonment such as in Paal Wilson  Co AS v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal 1983 1 AC 854 at 915916 There Lord Diplock considered that abandonment of a contract which was still executory involved the formation of a contract of abandonment in which each party promised to release the other from performance of all further obligations including the obligation to pay damages for past breaches arising under the executory and now abandoned contract Lord Brandon of Oakbrook who gave the leading speech see 1983 1 AC 900C per Lord Diplock said that the question of whether a contract has been abandoned or not is one of fact 1983 1 AC at 913F He continued 1983 1 AC at 914AC   The concept of the implied abandonment of a contract as a result of the conduct of the parties to it is well established in law  see Chitty on Contracts  23 rd ed 1968 vol 1 p 577 para 1231 and cases there cited Where A seeks to prove that he and B have abandoned a contract in this way there are two ways in which A can put his case The first way is by showing that the conduct of each party as evinced to the other party and acted on by him leads necessarily to the inference of an implied agreement between them to abandon the contract The second method is by showing that the conduct of B as evinced towards A has been such as to lead A reasonably to believe that B has abandoned the contract even though it has not in fact been Bs intention to do so and that A has significantly altered his position in reliance on that belief The first method involves actual abandonment by both A and B The second method involves the creation by B of a situation in which he is estopped from asserting as against A that he B has not abandoned the contract  Pearl Mill Co v Ivy Tannery Co Ltd 1919 1 KB 78    This contractual analysis is inapposite here but their Lordships approach shows that notwithstanding that arbitration proceedings have been regularly commenced and that both parties are bound to their pursuit the conduct of one party or both parties can bring about the legal consequence that the parties obligations to arbitrate in the arbitration proceedings have become abandoned or inoperative or incapable of being performed In international trade and commerce it is critical that the courts respect and enforce arbitration agreements where they exist in accordance with in particular the New York Convention and legislation designed to give effect to it such as the International Arbitration Act 1974 Cth This is because in international trade and commerce the parties generally will not wish to be subject to serendipity of where a ship may be arrested an action begun or damage occur to determine a forum of any litigation between them or the substantive law to be applied to their dispute The parties will be conscious that an accident or fortuity may occur at any point in a voyage or flight and very different legal results may flow depending on which law and which forum determine their dispute It is for this reason that arbitration clauses such as cl 45b invoking arbitration in London under English law have been a popular recourse for parties in international trade for over a century Nowadays other centres of commercial arbitration including Australia are recognized as providing sound and fair fora and laws for the resolution of disputes in international trade or commerce However the Court should be astute to uphold and enforce agreements such as those in cl 45b rather than to display a form of judicial prejudice or xenophobia against the parties chosen method or place of dispute resolution Refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate in international transactions is capable of undermining the reasonable but significant expectations of the international commercial community and the confidence which it and indeed local business people place in the readiness of courts to hold people to their bargains see eg Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v MV Sky Reefer 515 US 528 at 538 1995

as the method by which their disputes will be resolved by use of an arbitration agreement such as in cl 45b so they may also choose to give up their rights to use that method or they may so conduct themselves that the choice will be attributed to them by the doctrine of election When Comandate Marine chose to begin its in rem proceedings in the form which it utilized it brought about the consequence that it was taken to have elected not to pursue its arbitration proceedings It may have chosen another method to seek security by framing the relief it sought in its writ in a different way but it did not do so The English authorities on which Comandate Marine relied and to which Sheppard J referred did not consider the question of whether the party seeking security had made an election For that reason I think those authorities are distinguishable Because Comandate Marine elected to litigate the dispute and Pan has too the arbitration agreement in cl 45b has been in substance abandoned or for the purposes of s 75 of the International Arbitration Act 1974 Cth rendered inoperative or incapable of being performed  WAS THERE AN AGREEMENT IN WRITING   Pan argues that Art II r 2 of the New York Convention requires there to be either an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement which is either signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams Pan says that where the contract was formed as it argues the charter party was in this case either by acts or conduct Art II r 2 is not satisfied Pan says that each of the provision of the bank guarantee or the delivery of the vessel was an act or amounted to conduct which brought the contract into existence In support of the argument it relies on decision of the Supreme Court of Italy in Robobar Limited v Finncold SaS 1995 Year Book Comm Arbn XX 739 at 740 The Court held that where a purchase confirmation had been sent by the party seeking to rely on the arbitration clause to which the other party had not responded there was no doubt that none of the formalities in Art II in the New York Convention had been met because the clause was only contained in the confirmation to which the other party had not agreed by letter or telegram Pan also relied on a decision of the Court of Appeal of the Federal Republic of Germany in a case between a Dutch seller and a German buyer 1997 Year Book Comm Arbn Vol II 237 at 238 The Court of Appeal held that a declaration in writing of both sides to the contract was required A one sided confirmation did not suffice and the lack of declaration in writing by the other party could not be cured by that partys appearance in the arbitration In this matter however the critical telex of 20 April 2006 commenced by being in form a confirmation but ended with a request being made to both parties to confirm that the above recap was in line with the negotiations agreed so far The next relevant correspondence was the telex later that day noting that the bank guarantee had been received and indicating when delivery would occur I think this does fall within the positions contemplated by the Supreme Court of Italy and the German Court of Appeal as being ones in which the contract was not formed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams And In Zambia Steel  Building Supplies Ltd v James Clark  Eaton Ltd 1986 2 Lloyds Rep 225 at 234 Ralph Gibson LJ said   It is clear to me that the New York Convention by Art II par 2 did not impose upon the contracting state an obligation to recognise an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration unless it is signed by the parties or unless the agreement is contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams in the sense that the assent to be bound by both parties is given in writing by such document    The Manitoba Court of Appeal noted in Proctor v Schellenberg 2003 2 WWR 621 at 628 18 that Art IV r 1b of the New York Convention requires a party seeking to obtain recognition and enforcement of an award to provide the original agreement referred to in article II or a duly certified copy thereof They said that  there had to be a record to evidence the agreement of the parties to resolve the dispute by arbitral process in concluding that facsimile transmissions were sufficient to be or form part of an agreement in writing In AJ van den Bergs The New York Arbitration Convention of 1958 1981 at 196198 206 277 the learned author notes that Art II r 2 excludes oral or tacit acceptance and concluded at 197 227 that as at 1981 there had been only one  exception to the unanimous judicial affirmation that tacit acceptance does not comply with Art II r 2 that being a decision of the Court of First Instance of Rotterdam The learned author said that this decision was not in conformity with either the text of Art II r 2 or the intent of its drafters and noted that the decision had been rightly criticised Significantly he referred to the history of Art II r 2 which confirmed that the drafters of the New York Convention wished to exclude from its scope oral or tacit acceptance of a written proposal to arbitrate In his article Is the need for writing as expressed in the New York Convention and the Model Law out of step with commercial practice   1996 International Arbitration vol 12 no 1 p 27 at 32 Neil Kaplan QC affirmed Prof

UN DOC ECONF 26L54   The English and USSR delegates at the drafting session objected to that proposal and it was rejected van den Berg op cit at 196 Kaplan op cit 3233 Earlier as Kaplan J he had held in the High Court of Hong Kong in H Smal Limited v Goldroyce Garment Limited 1994 2 HKC 526 HCMP000 9081994 that there was no basis for arguing that an arbitration agreement could be established by a course of dealing or the conduct of the parties under Art VII of the Model Law see Schedule 2 to the International Arbitration Act 1974 Cth Kaplan J said that he had looked at the UNCITRAL reports in relation to Art VII and was quite satisfied that it could not be complied with unless there was a record in which the defendant in writing assented to the agreement to arbitrate see at 12 It has been recognized that a national courts in the interest of uniformity should construe rules formulated by an international convention especially rules formulated for the purpose of governing international transactions such as the hire of vessels or the carriage of goods in a normal manner appropriate for the interpretation of an international convention unconstrained by technical rules of English or domestic law or by English or domestic legal precedent but on broad principles of general acceptation Shipping Corporation of India Ltd v Gamlen Chemical Co Australasia Pty Ltd 1980 HCA 51  1980 147

to this approach when we are interpreting rules which have been formulated for the purpose of regulating the rights and liabilities of parties to international mercantile transactions where great store is set upon certainty and uniformity of application see too Great China Metal Industries Ltd v Malayasian International Shipping Corporation Berhad 1998 HCA 65  1988 196 CLR 161 at 186 71 per McHugh J   It is also important in construing international conventions that the views taken by courts particularly the Supreme Courts of nations are kept in mind so that there can be consistency in interpretation And I am conscious that in s 31 of the International Arbitration Act 1974 Cth the definition of arbitration agreement is that it is an agreement of the kind referred to in Art II r 2 As a matter of construction under Australian law I would have no hesitation in concluding that the definition was inclusive one However I think that the drafting of the definition in Art II r 2 invokes a concept of certainty that the arbitration clause or arbitration agreement is itself signed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams The precontractual exchanges of telexes and emails cannot themselves convert into separate or freestanding agreements in the present case unless and until the vessel was actually agreed to be fixed It was only upon the agreement to fix the vessel that it could be said to be under charter And as Capt Piperakis said he had imposed an absolute condition that a bank guarantee be provided The owners were not prepared to deliver the vessel on the evidence before me unless and until the bank guarantee had been received and it was at that point that they agreed that they were contractually bound That agreement which thus brought cl 45b into existence as an agreement to arbitrate was manifested by Comandate Marines conduct either in accepting the bank guarantee or later delivering the vessel At common law a recap telex can be found to contain a charter party including an arbitration clause which is incorporated by reference to an earlier telex or other communication even though both parties have not executed it The Epsilon Rosa 2003 2 Lloyds Rep 509 at 514 21 per Tuckey LJ May and Brooke LJJ agreeing But as Tuckey LJ pointed out 2003 2 Lloyds Rep at 515 29 one cannot generalize in these cases The act of acceptance which formed the contract was the provision of the bank guarantee And it is common ground that a formal charter party incorporating all of the agreed terms was to be prepared later by Prime on behalf of Comandate Marine Both parties were under a duty to cooperate to bring about the final form of their agreement in writing  Secured Income Real Estate Australia Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Limited 1979 HCA 51  1979 144 CLR 596 at 607 per Mason J applying Butt v MDonald 1896 7 QLJ 68 at 7071 per Griffith CJ No doubt cl 45b was part of the agreement between Pan and Comandate Marine But that does not of itself comply with Art II r 2 Rather the critical part of the conduct by which the contract was formed was the provision by a third party of the bank guarantee which brought the contract into existence So the contract being or including the arbitration agreement was not made by being signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of telexes or emails The contract included the conduct of the provision of the bank guarantee which fell outside the scope of Art II r 2 And because there is no evidence of any further written communication relied on as amounting to a document capable of being part of an exchange of letters or telegrams including telexes or emails then this series of communications does not satisfy the requirements of Art II r 2 A contract can be made by conduct evidencing a manifestation of assent to an offer Empirnall Holdings Pty Limited v Machon Paull Partners Pty Limited 1988 14 NSWLR 523 at 534535 per McHugh JA Samuels JA agreeing at 531 Accordingly I am of opinion that the telex from Prime to Mr Colaco headed FINAL RECAP was an offer by Comandate Marine to charter the vessel on the terms there set out and incorporated by reference which was capable of acceptance only by the provision of the bank guarantee For the reasons I have given based on the fairly settled interpretation of Art II r 2 that tacit acceptance is insufficient on the evidence I find that at the present time there is no agreement in writing for the purposes of Art II r 2 of the New York Convention  COMANDATE MARINES ALTERNATIVE CLAIM FOR STAY UNDER S 53 OF THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION ACT 1984 NSW   Comandate Marine argued that if an agreement in writing for the purposes of s 72 of the International Arbitration Act 1974 Cth were not found I should grant a stay pursuant to s 53 of the Commercial Arbitration Act 1984 NSW The Commercial Arbitration Act 1984 NSW provides that an arbitration agreement  means an agreement in writing to refer present or future disputes to arbitration see s 41 By s 531 the Court may stay the proceedings if it is satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration in accordance with the agreement and that the applicant was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration Having regard to the fact that Comandate Marine commenced its proceedings in rem as I have found without seeking to enforce any claim to arbitrate in those proceedings I am of opinion that the evidence establishes that Comandate Marine was not then ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration However its application for stay is made in Pans proceedings At the time when Pans proceedings were commenced Comandate Marine was pursuing the arbitration proceedings and still seeks to do so now I do not think that makes the commencement of the proceedings in rem irrelevant By s 532  the leave of the Court is required in the proceedings which have been commenced where the applicant for stay has delivered pleadings or taken any other steps in the proceedings other than the entry of an appearance Although Comandate Marines proceedings in rem were in separate proceedings they form as I have held part of the same matter for the purposes of ss 75 and 76 of the Constitution  and I am not minded to exercise any discretion in favour of Comandate Marine having regard to its conduct in taking the in rem proceedings in the circumstances which I have found  SCOPE OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE   Comandate Marine argued that the claims brought under ss 51A  52 and 55A of the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth and seeking relief under ss 82 and 87  including relief setting aside ab initio the charter party and preventing Comandate Marine from enforcing against the plaintiff any arbitral award were colourable It was not put that the claims were an abuse of the process of the Court Rather it was put in oral argument that there had been a misuse of s 12 of the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth because the very complaints the subject of the claims under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth were in essence the same as the breaches of contract relied on by Pan Comandate Marine in written submissions asserted that the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth claims had been made for the improper purpose of fabricating jurisdiction I do not think this argument has any substance Part V of the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth in which s 52 is found sets out a statutory norm of conduct to which corporations must conform in trade or commerce The task of the Court is to apply such norms where they arise in litigation even where the outcome is not materially different to applying the common law of negligence as in Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree 2005 HCA 69  2005 80 ALJR 183 at 191 29 per Gleeson CJ or of passing off as in Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd 2000 HCA 12  2000 202 CLR 45 at 83 97  In the latter case the whole court approved what Mason J had said in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd 1982 HCA 44  1982 149 CLR 191 at 205 see 202 CLR at 83 97 in the following terms   Likewise the operation of s 52 is not restricted by the common law principles relating to passingoff If as I consider the section provides the public with wider protection from deception than the common law it does not follow that there is a conflict between the section and the common law The statute provides an additional remedy  emphasis added   I am of opinion that the statutory remedy relied on by Pan is additional to whatever contractual remedies may be available to it and that there is no basis for the attribution to Pan of any improper purpose to fabricate jurisdiction The Parliament of the Commonwealth has enacted the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth under the trade and commerce power in s 51i of the Constitution  There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Pan has not properly and regularly invoked the Courts jurisdiction Pans pleading raises an issue of substance as to whether or not Comandate Marine engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct I am satisfied that this is truly part of the one controversy which the Court has been asked to quell cf DOrta Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid 2005 HCA 12  2005 79 ALJR 755 at 761 32  The only arguable limitation in the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth which might be seen as restricting the jurisdiction or powers any court invested with jurisdiction under that Act is to be found in s 13 But on examination s 13 does not affect the jurisdiction which a court including this Court has from sources other than the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth itself Rather s 13 provides that the Act does not confer on or invest jurisdiction on or in a court in a matter which is not of a kind mentioned in ss 76ii or iii of the Constitution  In ascertaining the scope of jurisdiction which the Federal Court may exercise s 13 thus provides some guidance It contemplates that matters of a kind mentioned in ss 76ii and iii of the Constitution can be within the jurisdiction of the Court Section 76iii of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction is a clear source of power to enact the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth itself and define maritime claims as well as associated matters of Admiralty and marine jurisdiction in ss 4 and 12  And s 76ii provides that the judicial power of the Commonwealth is invoked in any matter arising under any laws made by the Parliament The purpose of s 13 is to limit in the construction of the Act the conferral of jurisdiction by the Act to matters within the power of the Parliament and the judicial power of the Commonwealth It is not to limit the other powers of a court on or in which the Act confers or invests jurisdiction Clearly enough s 86 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth is a law made by the Parliament which confers jurisdiction on this Court independently of the jurisdiction conferred on it by the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth It is quite inappropriate to read provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court by making

courts exercising jurisdiction conferred by the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth by s 31 But s 311 provides that the liability on a judgment of a relevant person defined by s 31 as a person who would be liable were the proceedings in personam brought against that person who has entered an appearance in a proceeding on a maritime claim commenced as an action in rem against a ship or property is not limited to the value of the ship or other property The section confirms the amplitude of the jurisdiction rather than restricts it Next Comandate Marine argued that a relevant person who appears in proceedings commenced by a writ in rem cannot be sued in proceedings in personam in this Court in respect of matters outside the relief claimed in the writ in rem on a cause of action other than a maritime claim within the meaning of s 4 of the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth or on associated matters of admiralty and marine jurisdiction within the meaning of s 12 of that Act Here part of the matter within the meaning of ss 76ii and iii of the Constitution  is the controversy between the parties under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth which Pan has pleaded The judicial power of the Commonwealth is exercised in resolving such matters Here the controversy involves claims under two Acts of the Parliament each of which specifically and independently one of the other confers jurisdiction on this Court Accordingly I am of opinion that this Court does have jurisdiction to hear and determine such an in personam proceeding as this That is not to say however that the ship or property the subject of the writ in rem will be available necessarily to answer any judgment for any in personam claim against a relevant person such as one under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth which is neither a maritime claim or an associated matter within the meaning of ss 4 or 12  I am of opinion that the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth cannot be construed as in any way limiting the jurisdiction of this Court to hear and determine any matter within its jurisdiction Rather appositely to the present proceedings there may be a question at the trial as to the availability of the bank guarantee which Comandate Marine provided as security in lieu of the ship Comandate to satisfy a claim made by Pan which is not within ss 4 or 12 of the Act Pans claim in personam for relief under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth is not invalid and its proceedings in personam are not invalidated by that claim s 51 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 Cth The Court at the final hearing can address any injustice which might arise if Comandate Marine wishes then to agitate such matters including whether the security provided should be available to satisfy any claim under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth The Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth provides Pan with remedies different to any remedy that could be awarded in pursuance of its contract claims Indeed one of the remedies it seeks is the avoidance of the contract not pursuant to contractual principles but by force of an order under s 87 of the Act Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Limited 2004 HCA 3  2004 216 CLR 388 at 409 52  And the High Court has emphasized that the remedies under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth are designed to give effect in cases of contravention of s 52  to the prescribed standards of conduct which are embodied in that section where

And Art 81 of the Model Law relevantly requires a court in which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement to refer the parties to arbitration if a party so requests no later than when submitting its first statement on the substance of the dispute 59 Russell on Arbitration 22 nd ed at 610 A5018 refers to Art 81 having the same effect as English law ie the party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement must apply to the court without delay for a stay of the proceedings op cit at 296 7005 The position is similar under s 532 of the Commercial Arbitration Act 1984 NSW which applies here by force of s 79 of the Judiciary Act 1903 Cth Comandate Marine did not apply to have its proceedings referred to arbitration when they were before this Court or the High Court I am of opinion that Comandate Marines conduct in bringing its proceedings in rem was incompatible with the arbitration agreement and that Art 81 and Art 9 of the Model Law do not avail it Comandate Marine is in a similar position to that of the landlord in the example given by Parker J in Matthews v Smallwood 1910 1 Ch at 786787 By pleading the writ in the way which it did Comandate Marine exercised a right of action given by the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth to litigate the breach of the charter party as a general maritime claim under s 43f of the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth in this Court I am of opinion that in choosing to claim only that relief when it invoked the jurisdiction of the Court Comandate Marine could not do that without prejudice to any right it might otherwise have had to seek security for the arbitration under s 29 at a later stage It made no such claim in the writ and it procured the arrest of the vessel for the purposes of the particular relief which it claimed in the writ The way in which Comandate Marine framed its claim in the writ nailed its colours to the mast as much as the warrant for arrest later was nailed notionally or actually to the mast of the Boomerang I  Having invoked the jurisdiction of the Court to procure the arrest of the vessel in order to pursue the only claims it pleaded it is not open to Comandate Marine now to say that it did so without prejudice to any right later to apply for security under s 29 of the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth In its report Civil Admiralty Jurisdiction Report No 33 1986 Law Reform Commission Australia the Commission recommended the introduction of what has become s 29 so as to enable the Admiralty jurisdiction to be used to obtain and retain security even though the merits of the dispute are to be determined elsewhere if the subject matter of the dispute lies within Admiralty jurisdiction The Commission noted that such a solution would do most to ensure that the award of the tribunal that decides upon the merits is satisfied and hence that a just result would be obtained It noted that the law had a strong interest in compliance with arbitral awards duly made and in achieving cooperation between courts and arbitrators to this end However the Commission desired in the solution it proposed that the Court should retain a discretion to stay or to exercise jurisdiction to decide the merits ALRC 33 189 That discretion was to arise in the Court being able to take into account all relevant circumstances although the Commission noted that as at 1986 English and South African courts required the plaintiff to demonstrate why the assistance of a court was required in retaining security although there were shades of difference between the readiness of the respective jurisdictions to assist in respect of claims otherwise unconnected with the forum The Tuyuti 1984 QB 838 at 851 Katagum Wholesale Commodities v The MV Paz 1984 3 SAf LR 261 at 268 270 Natal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa Neither party argued that the analysis of the present question should be approached on the basis that there had been a contract of abandonment such as in Paal Wilson  Co AS v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal 1983 1 AC 854 at 915916 There Lord Diplock considered that abandonment of a contract which was still executory involved the formation of a contract of abandonment in which each party promised to release the other from performance of all further obligations including the obligation to pay damages for past breaches arising under the executory and now abandoned contract Lord Brandon of Oakbrook who gave the leading speech see 1983 1 AC 900C per Lord Diplock said that the question of whether a contract has been abandoned or not is one of fact 1983 1 AC at 913F He continued 1983 1 AC at 914AC   The concept of the implied abandonment of a contract as a result of the conduct of the parties to it is well established in law  see Chitty on Contracts  23 rd ed 1968 vol 1 p 577 para 1231 and cases there cited Where A seeks to prove that he and B have abandoned a contract in this way there are two ways in which A can put his case The first way is by showing that the conduct of each party as evinced to the other party and acted on by him leads necessarily to the inference of an implied agreement between them to abandon the contract The second method is by showing that the conduct of B as evinced towards A has been such as to lead A reasonably to believe that B has abandoned the contract even though it has not in fact been Bs intention to do so and that A has significantly altered his position in reliance on that belief The first method involves actual abandonment by both A and B The second method involves the creation by B of a situation in which he is estopped from asserting as against A that he B has not abandoned the contract  Pearl Mill Co v Ivy Tannery Co Ltd 1919 1 KB 78    This contractual analysis is inapposite here but their Lordships approach shows that notwithstanding that arbitration proceedings have been regularly commenced and that both parties are bound to their pursuit the conduct of one party or both parties can bring about the legal consequence that the parties obligations to arbitrate in the arbitration proceedings have become abandoned or inoperative or incapable of being performed In international trade and commerce it is critical that the courts respect and enforce arbitration agreements where they exist in accordance with in particular the New York Convention and legislation designed to give effect to it such as the International Arbitration Act 1974 Cth This is because in international trade and commerce the parties generally will not wish to be subject to serendipity of where a ship may be arrested an action begun or damage occur to determine a forum of any litigation between them or the substantive law to be applied to their dispute The parties will be conscious that an accident or fortuity may occur at any point in a voyage or flight and very different legal results may flow depending on which law and which forum determine their dispute It is for this reason that arbitration clauses such as cl 45b invoking arbitration in London under English law have been a popular recourse for parties in international trade for over a century Nowadays other centres of commercial arbitration including Australia are recognized as providing sound and fair fora and laws for the resolution of disputes in international trade or commerce However the Court should be astute to uphold and enforce agreements such as those in cl 45b rather than to display a form of judicial prejudice or xenophobia against the parties chosen method or place of dispute resolution Refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate in international transactions is capable of undermining the reasonable but significant expectations of the international commercial community and the confidence which it and indeed local business people place in the readiness of courts to hold people to their bargains see eg Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v MV Sky Reefer 515 US 528 at 538 1995

as the method by which their disputes will be resolved by use of an arbitration agreement such as in cl 45b so they may also choose to give up their rights to use that method or they may so conduct themselves that the choice will be attributed to them by the doctrine of election When Comandate Marine chose to begin its in rem proceedings in the form which it utilized it brought about the consequence that it was taken to have elected not to pursue its arbitration proceedings It may have chosen another method to seek security by framing the relief it sought in its writ in a different way but it did not do so The English authorities on which Comandate Marine relied and to which Sheppard J referred did not consider the question of whether the party seeking security had made an election For that reason I think those authorities are distinguishable Because Comandate Marine elected to litigate the dispute and Pan has too the arbitration agreement in cl 45b has been in substance abandoned or for the purposes of s 75 of the International Arbitration Act 1974 Cth rendered inoperative or incapable of being performed  WAS THERE AN AGREEMENT IN WRITING   Pan argues that Art II r 2 of the New York Convention requires there to be either an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement which is either signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams Pan says that where the contract was formed as it argues the charter party was in this case either by acts or conduct Art II r 2 is not satisfied Pan says that each of the provision of the bank guarantee or the delivery of the vessel was an act or amounted to conduct which brought the contract into existence In support of the argument it relies on decision of the Supreme Court of Italy in Robobar Limited v Finncold SaS 1995 Year Book Comm Arbn XX 739 at 740 The Court held that where a purchase confirmation had been sent by the party seeking to rely on the arbitration clause to which the other party had not responded there was no doubt that none of the formalities in Art II in the New York Convention had been met because the clause was only contained in the confirmation to which the other party had not agreed by letter or telegram Pan also relied on a decision of the Court of Appeal of the Federal Republic of Germany in a case between a Dutch seller and a German buyer 1997 Year Book Comm Arbn Vol II 237 at 238 The Court of Appeal held that a declaration in writing of both sides to the contract was required A one sided confirmation did not suffice and the lack of declaration in writing by the other party could not be cured by that partys appearance in the arbitration In this matter however the critical telex of 20 April 2006 commenced by being in form a confirmation but ended with a request being made to both parties to confirm that the above recap was in line with the negotiations agreed so far The next relevant correspondence was the telex later that day noting that the bank guarantee had been received and indicating when delivery would occur I think this does fall within the positions contemplated by the Supreme Court of Italy and the German Court of Appeal as being ones in which the contract was not formed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams And In Zambia Steel  Building Supplies Ltd v James Clark  Eaton Ltd 1986 2 Lloyds Rep 225 at 234 Ralph Gibson LJ said   It is clear to me that the New York Convention by Art II par 2 did not impose upon the contracting state an obligation to recognise an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration unless it is signed by the parties or unless the agreement is contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams in the sense that the assent to be bound by both parties is given in writing by such document    The Manitoba Court of Appeal noted in Proctor v Schellenberg 2003 2 WWR 621 at 628 18 that Art IV r 1b of the New York Convention requires a party seeking to obtain recognition and enforcement of an award to provide the original agreement referred to in article II or a duly certified copy thereof They said that  there had to be a record to evidence the agreement of the parties to resolve the dispute by arbitral process in concluding that facsimile transmissions were sufficient to be or form part of an agreement in writing In AJ van den Bergs The New York Arbitration Convention of 1958 1981 at 196198 206 277 the learned author notes that Art II r 2 excludes oral or tacit acceptance and concluded at 197 227 that as at 1981 there had been only one  exception to the unanimous judicial affirmation that tacit acceptance does not comply with Art II r 2 that being a decision of the Court of First Instance of Rotterdam The learned author said that this decision was not in conformity with either the text of Art II r 2 or the intent of its drafters and noted that the decision had been rightly criticised Significantly he referred to the history of Art II r 2 which confirmed that the drafters of the New York Convention wished to exclude from its scope oral or tacit acceptance of a written proposal to arbitrate In his article Is the need for writing as expressed in the New York Convention and the Model Law out of step with commercial practice   1996 International Arbitration vol 12 no 1 p 27 at 32 Neil Kaplan QC affirmed Prof

UN DOC ECONF 26L54   The English and USSR delegates at the drafting session objected to that proposal and it was rejected van den Berg op cit at 196 Kaplan op cit 3233 Earlier as Kaplan J he had held in the High Court of Hong Kong in H Smal Limited v Goldroyce Garment Limited 1994 2 HKC 526 HCMP000 9081994 that there was no basis for arguing that an arbitration agreement could be established by a course of dealing or the conduct of the parties under Art VII of the Model Law see Schedule 2 to the International Arbitration Act 1974 Cth Kaplan J said that he had looked at the UNCITRAL reports in relation to Art VII and was quite satisfied that it could not be complied with unless there was a record in which the defendant in writing assented to the agreement to arbitrate see at 12 It has been recognized that a national courts in the interest of uniformity should construe rules formulated by an international convention especially rules formulated for the purpose of governing international transactions such as the hire of vessels or the carriage of goods in a normal manner appropriate for the interpretation of an international convention unconstrained by technical rules of English or domestic law or by English or domestic legal precedent but on broad principles of general acceptation Shipping Corporation of India Ltd v Gamlen Chemical Co Australasia Pty Ltd 1980 HCA 51  1980 147

to this approach when we are interpreting rules which have been formulated for the purpose of regulating the rights and liabilities of parties to international mercantile transactions where great store is set upon certainty and uniformity of application see too Great China Metal Industries Ltd v Malayasian International Shipping Corporation Berhad 1998 HCA 65  1988 196 CLR 161 at 186 71 per McHugh J   It is also important in construing international conventions that the views taken by courts particularly the Supreme Courts of nations are kept in mind so that there can be consistency in interpretation And I am conscious that in s 31 of the International Arbitration Act 1974 Cth the definition of arbitration agreement is that it is an agreement of the kind referred to in Art II r 2 As a matter of construction under Australian law I would have no hesitation in concluding that the definition was inclusive one However I think that the drafting of the definition in Art II r 2 invokes a concept of certainty that the arbitration clause or arbitration agreement is itself signed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams The precontractual exchanges of telexes and emails cannot themselves convert into separate or freestanding agreements in the present case unless and until the vessel was actually agreed to be fixed It was only upon the agreement to fix the vessel that it could be said to be under charter And as Capt Piperakis said he had imposed an absolute condition that a bank guarantee be provided The owners were not prepared to deliver the vessel on the evidence before me unless and until the bank guarantee had been received and it was at that point that they agreed that they were contractually bound That agreement which thus brought cl 45b into existence as an agreement to arbitrate was manifested by Comandate Marines conduct either in accepting the bank guarantee or later delivering the vessel At common law a recap telex can be found to contain a charter party including an arbitration clause which is incorporated by reference to an earlier telex or other communication even though both parties have not executed it The Epsilon Rosa 2003 2 Lloyds Rep 509 at 514 21 per Tuckey LJ May and Brooke LJJ agreeing But as Tuckey LJ pointed out 2003 2 Lloyds Rep at 515 29 one cannot generalize in these cases The act of acceptance which formed the contract was the provision of the bank guarantee And it is common ground that a formal charter party incorporating all of the agreed terms was to be prepared later by Prime on behalf of Comandate Marine Both parties were under a duty to cooperate to bring about the final form of their agreement in writing  Secured Income Real Estate Australia Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Limited 1979 HCA 51  1979 144 CLR 596 at 607 per Mason J applying Butt v MDonald 1896 7 QLJ 68 at 7071 per Griffith CJ No doubt cl 45b was part of the agreement between Pan and Comandate Marine But that does not of itself comply with Art II r 2 Rather the critical part of the conduct by which the contract was formed was the provision by a third party of the bank guarantee which brought the contract into existence So the contract being or including the arbitration agreement was not made by being signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of telexes or emails The contract included the conduct of the provision of the bank guarantee which fell outside the scope of Art II r 2 And because there is no evidence of any further written communication relied on as amounting to a document capable of being part of an exchange of letters or telegrams including telexes or emails then this series of communications does not satisfy the requirements of Art II r 2 A contract can be made by conduct evidencing a manifestation of assent to an offer Empirnall Holdings Pty Limited v Machon Paull Partners Pty Limited 1988 14 NSWLR 523 at 534535 per McHugh JA Samuels JA agreeing at 531 Accordingly I am of opinion that the telex from Prime to Mr Colaco headed FINAL RECAP was an offer by Comandate Marine to charter the vessel on the terms there set out and incorporated by reference which was capable of acceptance only by the provision of the bank guarantee For the reasons I have given based on the fairly settled interpretation of Art II r 2 that tacit acceptance is insufficient on the evidence I find that at the present time there is no agreement in writing for the purposes of Art II r 2 of the New York Convention  COMANDATE MARINES ALTERNATIVE CLAIM FOR STAY UNDER S 53 OF THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION ACT 1984 NSW   Comandate Marine argued that if an agreement in writing for the purposes of s 72 of the International Arbitration Act 1974 Cth were not found I should grant a stay pursuant to s 53 of the Commercial Arbitration Act 1984 NSW The Commercial Arbitration Act 1984 NSW provides that an arbitration agreement  means an agreement in writing to refer present or future disputes to arbitration see s 41 By s 531 the Court may stay the proceedings if it is satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration in accordance with the agreement and that the applicant was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration Having regard to the fact that Comandate Marine commenced its proceedings in rem as I have found without seeking to enforce any claim to arbitrate in those proceedings I am of opinion that the evidence establishes that Comandate Marine was not then ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration However its application for stay is made in Pans proceedings At the time when Pans proceedings were commenced Comandate Marine was pursuing the arbitration proceedings and still seeks to do so now I do not think that makes the commencement of the proceedings in rem irrelevant By s 532  the leave of the Court is required in the proceedings which have been commenced where the applicant for stay has delivered pleadings or taken any other steps in the proceedings other than the entry of an appearance Although Comandate Marines proceedings in rem were in separate proceedings they form as I have held part of the same matter for the purposes of ss 75 and 76 of the Constitution  and I am not minded to exercise any discretion in favour of Comandate Marine having regard to its conduct in taking the in rem proceedings in the circumstances which I have found  SCOPE OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE   Comandate Marine argued that the claims brought under ss 51A  52 and 55A of the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth and seeking relief under ss 82 and 87  including relief setting aside ab initio the charter party and preventing Comandate Marine from enforcing against the plaintiff any arbitral award were colourable It was not put that the claims were an abuse of the process of the Court Rather it was put in oral argument that there had been a misuse of s 12 of the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth because the very complaints the subject of the claims under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth were in essence the same as the breaches of contract relied on by Pan Comandate Marine in written submissions asserted that the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth claims had been made for the improper purpose of fabricating jurisdiction I do not think this argument has any substance Part V of the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth in which s 52 is found sets out a statutory norm of conduct to which corporations must conform in trade or commerce The task of the Court is to apply such norms where they arise in litigation even where the outcome is not materially different to applying the common law of negligence as in Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree 2005 HCA 69  2005 80 ALJR 183 at 191 29 per Gleeson CJ or of passing off as in Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd 2000 HCA 12  2000 202 CLR 45 at 83 97  In the latter case the whole court approved what Mason J had said in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd 1982 HCA 44  1982 149 CLR 191 at 205 see 202 CLR at 83 97 in the following terms   Likewise the operation of s 52 is not restricted by the common law principles relating to passingoff If as I consider the section provides the public with wider protection from deception than the common law it does not follow that there is a conflict between the section and the common law The statute provides an additional remedy  emphasis added   I am of opinion that the statutory remedy relied on by Pan is additional to whatever contractual remedies may be available to it and that there is no basis for the attribution to Pan of any improper purpose to fabricate jurisdiction The Parliament of the Commonwealth has enacted the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth under the trade and commerce power in s 51i of the Constitution  There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Pan has not properly and regularly invoked the Courts jurisdiction Pans pleading raises an issue of substance as to whether or not Comandate Marine engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct I am satisfied that this is truly part of the one controversy which the Court has been asked to quell cf DOrta Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid 2005 HCA 12  2005 79 ALJR 755 at 761 32  The only arguable limitation in the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth which might be seen as restricting the jurisdiction or powers any court invested with jurisdiction under that Act is to be found in s 13 But on examination s 13 does not affect the jurisdiction which a court including this Court has from sources other than the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth itself Rather s 13 provides that the Act does not confer on or invest jurisdiction on or in a court in a matter which is not of a kind mentioned in ss 76ii or iii of the Constitution  In ascertaining the scope of jurisdiction which the Federal Court may exercise s 13 thus provides some guidance It contemplates that matters of a kind mentioned in ss 76ii and iii of the Constitution can be within the jurisdiction of the Court Section 76iii of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction is a clear source of power to enact the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth itself and define maritime claims as well as associated matters of Admiralty and marine jurisdiction in ss 4 and 12  And s 76ii provides that the judicial power of the Commonwealth is invoked in any matter arising under any laws made by the Parliament The purpose of s 13 is to limit in the construction of the Act the conferral of jurisdiction by the Act to matters within the power of the Parliament and the judicial power of the Commonwealth It is not to limit the other powers of a court on or in which the Act confers or invests jurisdiction Clearly enough s 86 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth is a law made by the Parliament which confers jurisdiction on this Court independently of the jurisdiction conferred on it by the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth It is quite inappropriate to read provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court by making implications or imposing limitations which are not found in the express words Owners of Shin Kobe Maru v Empire Shipping Co Inc 1994 HCA 54  1994 181 CLR 404 at 421 see too Mansfield v Director of

courts exercising jurisdiction conferred by the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth by s 31 But s 311 provides that the liability on a judgment of a relevant person defined by s 31 as a person who would be liable were the proceedings in personam brought against that person who has entered an appearance in a proceeding on a maritime claim commenced as an action in rem against a ship or property is not limited to the value of the ship or other property The section confirms the amplitude of the jurisdiction rather than restricts it Next Comandate Marine argued that a relevant person who appears in proceedings commenced by a writ in rem cannot be sued in proceedings in personam in this Court in respect of matters outside the relief claimed in the writ in rem on a cause of action other than a maritime claim within the meaning of s 4 of the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth or on associated matters of admiralty and marine jurisdiction within the meaning of s 12 of that Act Here part of the matter within the meaning of ss 76ii and iii of the Constitution  is the controversy between the parties under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth which Pan has pleaded The judicial power of the Commonwealth is exercised in resolving such matters Here the controversy involves claims under two Acts of the Parliament each of which specifically and independently one of the other confers jurisdiction on this Court Accordingly I am of opinion that this Court does have jurisdiction to hear and determine such an in personam proceeding as this That is not to say however that the ship or property the subject of the writ in rem will be available necessarily to answer any judgment for any in personam claim against a relevant person such as one under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth which is neither a maritime claim or an associated matter within the meaning of ss 4 or 12  I am of opinion that the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth cannot be construed as in any way limiting the jurisdiction of this Court to hear and determine any matter within its jurisdiction Rather appositely to the present proceedings there may be a question at the trial as to the availability of the bank guarantee which Comandate Marine provided as security in lieu of the ship Comandate to satisfy a claim made by Pan which is not within ss 4 or 12 of the Act Pans claim in personam for relief under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth is not invalid and its proceedings in personam are not invalidated by that claim s 51 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 Cth The Court at the final hearing can address any injustice which might arise if Comandate Marine wishes then to agitate such matters including whether the security provided should be available to satisfy any claim under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth The Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth provides Pan with remedies different to any remedy that could be awarded in pursuance of its contract claims Indeed one of the remedies it seeks is the avoidance of the contract not pursuant to contractual principles but by force of an order under s 87 of the Act Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Limited 2004 HCA 3  2004 216 CLR 388 at 409 52  And the High Court has emphasized that the remedies under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth are designed to give effect in cases of contravention of s 52  to the prescribed standards of conduct which are embodied in that section where activities occur in trade or commerce Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited 2000 HCA 12  2000 202 CLR 45 at 83 97  Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree 2005 HCA 69  2005 80 ALJR 183

06_1112.xml,c15,discussed,Francis Travel Marketing Pty Limited v Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd (1996) 39 NSWLR 160,As noted above Comandate Marines proceedings in rem contained no such request And Art 81 of the Model Law relevantly requires a court in which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement to refer the parties to arbitration if a party so requests no later than when submitting its first statement on the substance of the dispute 59 Russell on Arbitration 22 nd ed at 610 A5018 refers to Art 81 having the same effect as English law ie the party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement must apply to the court without delay for a stay of the proceedings op cit at 296 7005 The position is similar under s 532 of the Commercial Arbitration Act 1984 NSW which applies here by force of s 79 of the Judiciary Act 1903 Cth Comandate Marine did not apply to have its proceedings referred to arbitration when they were before this Court or the High Court I am of opinion that Comandate Marines conduct in bringing its proceedings in rem was incompatible with the arbitration agreement and that Art 81 and Art 9 of the Model Law do not avail it Comandate Marine is in a similar position to that of the landlord in the example given by Parker J in Matthews v Smallwood 1910 1 Ch at 786787 By pleading the writ in the way which it did Comandate Marine exercised a right of action given by the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth to litigate the breach of the charter party as a general maritime claim under s 43f of the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth in this Court I am of opinion that in choosing to claim only that relief when it invoked the jurisdiction of the Court Comandate Marine could not do that without prejudice to any right it might otherwise have had to seek security for the arbitration under s 29 at a later stage It made no such claim in the writ and it procured the arrest of the vessel for the purposes of the particular relief which it claimed in the writ The way in which Comandate Marine framed its claim in the writ nailed its colours to the mast as much as the warrant for arrest later was nailed notionally or actually to the mast of the Boomerang I  Having invoked the jurisdiction of the Court to procure the arrest of the vessel in order to pursue the only claims it pleaded it is not open to Comandate Marine now to say that it did so without prejudice to any right later to apply for security under s 29 of the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth In its report Civil Admiralty Jurisdiction Report No 33 1986 Law Reform Commission Australia the Commission recommended the introduction of what has become s 29 so as to enable the Admiralty jurisdiction to be used to obtain and retain security even though the merits of the dispute are to be determined elsewhere if the subject matter of the dispute lies within Admiralty jurisdiction The Commission noted that such a solution would do most to ensure that the award of the tribunal that decides upon the merits is satisfied and hence that a just result would be obtained It noted that the law had a strong interest in compliance with arbitral awards duly made and in achieving cooperation between courts and arbitrators to this end However the Commission desired in the solution it proposed that the Court should retain a discretion to stay or to exercise jurisdiction to decide the merits ALRC 33 189 That discretion was to arise in the Court being able to take into account all relevant circumstances although the Commission noted that as at 1986 English and South African courts required the plaintiff to demonstrate why the assistance of a court was required in retaining security although there were shades of difference between the readiness of the respective jurisdictions to assist in respect of claims otherwise unconnected with the forum The Tuyuti 1984 QB 838 at 851 Katagum Wholesale Commodities v The MV Paz 1984 3 SAf LR 261 at 268 270 Natal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa Neither party argued that the analysis of the present question should be approached on the basis that there had been a contract of abandonment such as in Paal Wilson  Co AS v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal 1983 1 AC 854 at 915916 There Lord Diplock considered that abandonment of a contract which was still executory involved the formation of a contract of abandonment in which each party promised to release the other from performance of all further obligations including the obligation to pay damages for past breaches arising under the executory and now abandoned contract Lord Brandon of Oakbrook who gave the leading speech see 1983 1 AC 900C per Lord Diplock said that the question of whether a contract has been abandoned or not is one of fact 1983 1 AC at 913F He continued 1983 1 AC at 914AC   The concept of the implied abandonment of a contract as a result of the conduct of the parties to it is well established in law  see Chitty on Contracts  23 rd ed 1968 vol 1 p 577 para 1231 and cases there cited Where A seeks to prove that he and B have abandoned a contract in this way there are two ways in which A can put his case The first way is by showing that the conduct of each party as evinced to the other party and acted on by him leads necessarily to the inference of an implied agreement between them to abandon the contract The second method is by showing that the conduct of B as evinced towards A has been such as to lead A reasonably to believe that B has abandoned the contract even though it has not in fact been Bs intention to do so and that A has significantly altered his position in reliance on that belief The first method involves actual abandonment by both A and B The second method involves the creation by B of a situation in which he is estopped from asserting as against A that he B has not abandoned the contract  Pearl Mill Co v Ivy Tannery Co Ltd 1919 1 KB 78    This contractual analysis is inapposite here but their Lordships approach shows that notwithstanding that arbitration proceedings have been regularly commenced and that both parties are bound to their pursuit the conduct of one party or both parties can bring about the legal consequence that the parties obligations to arbitrate in the arbitration proceedings have become abandoned or inoperative or incapable of being performed In international trade and commerce it is critical that the courts respect and enforce arbitration agreements where they exist in accordance with in particular the New York Convention and legislation designed to give effect to it such as the International Arbitration Act 1974 Cth This is because in international trade and commerce the parties generally will not wish to be subject to serendipity of where a ship may be arrested an action begun or damage occur to determine a forum of any litigation between them or the substantive law to be applied to their dispute The parties will be conscious that an accident or fortuity may occur at any point in a voyage or flight and very different legal results may flow depending on which law and which forum determine their dispute It is for this reason that arbitration clauses such as cl 45b invoking arbitration in London under English law have been a popular recourse for parties in international trade for over a century Nowadays other centres of commercial arbitration including Australia are recognized as providing sound and fair fora and laws for the resolution of disputes in international trade or commerce However the Court should be astute to uphold and enforce agreements such as those in cl 45b rather than to display a form of judicial prejudice or xenophobia against the parties chosen method or place of dispute resolution Refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate in international transactions is capable of undermining the reasonable but significant expectations of the international commercial community and the confidence which it and indeed local business people place in the readiness of courts to hold people to their bargains see eg Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v MV Sky Reefer 515 US 528 at 538 1995

as the method by which their disputes will be resolved by use of an arbitration agreement such as in cl 45b so they may also choose to give up their rights to use that method or they may so conduct themselves that the choice will be attributed to them by the doctrine of election When Comandate Marine chose to begin its in rem proceedings in the form which it utilized it brought about the consequence that it was taken to have elected not to pursue its arbitration proceedings It may have chosen another method to seek security by framing the relief it sought in its writ in a different way but it did not do so The English authorities on which Comandate Marine relied and to which Sheppard J referred did not consider the question of whether the party seeking security had made an election For that reason I think those authorities are distinguishable Because Comandate Marine elected to litigate the dispute and Pan has too the arbitration agreement in cl 45b has been in substance abandoned or for the purposes of s 75 of the International Arbitration Act 1974 Cth rendered inoperative or incapable of being performed  WAS THERE AN AGREEMENT IN WRITING   Pan argues that Art II r 2 of the New York Convention requires there to be either an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement which is either signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams Pan says that where the contract was formed as it argues the charter party was in this case either by acts or conduct Art II r 2 is not satisfied Pan says that each of the provision of the bank guarantee or the delivery of the vessel was an act or amounted to conduct which brought the contract into existence In support of the argument it relies on decision of the Supreme Court of Italy in Robobar Limited v Finncold SaS 1995 Year Book Comm Arbn XX 739 at 740 The Court held that where a purchase confirmation had been sent by the party seeking to rely on the arbitration clause to which the other party had not responded there was no doubt that none of the formalities in Art II in the New York Convention had been met because the clause was only contained in the confirmation to which the other party had not agreed by letter or telegram Pan also relied on a decision of the Court of Appeal of the Federal Republic of Germany in a case between a Dutch seller and a German buyer 1997 Year Book Comm Arbn Vol II 237 at 238 The Court of Appeal held that a declaration in writing of both sides to the contract was required A one sided confirmation did not suffice and the lack of declaration in writing by the other party could not be cured by that partys appearance in the arbitration In this matter however the critical telex of 20 April 2006 commenced by being in form a confirmation but ended with a request being made to both parties to confirm that the above recap was in line with the negotiations agreed so far The next relevant correspondence was the telex later that day noting that the bank guarantee had been received and indicating when delivery would occur I think this does fall within the positions contemplated by the Supreme Court of Italy and the German Court of Appeal as being ones in which the contract was not formed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams And In Zambia Steel  Building Supplies Ltd v James Clark  Eaton Ltd 1986 2 Lloyds Rep 225 at 234 Ralph Gibson LJ said   It is clear to me that the New York Convention by Art II par 2 did not impose upon the contracting state an obligation to recognise an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration unless it is signed by the parties or unless the agreement is contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams in the sense that the assent to be bound by both parties is given in writing by such document    The Manitoba Court of Appeal noted in Proctor v Schellenberg 2003 2 WWR 621 at 628 18 that Art IV r 1b of the New York Convention requires a party seeking to obtain recognition and enforcement of an award to provide the original agreement referred to in article II or a duly certified copy thereof They said that  there had to be a record to evidence the agreement of the parties to resolve the dispute by arbitral process in concluding that facsimile transmissions were sufficient to be or form part of an agreement in writing In AJ van den Bergs The New York Arbitration Convention of 1958 1981 at 196198 206 277 the learned author notes that Art II r 2 excludes oral or tacit acceptance and concluded at 197 227 that as at 1981 there had been only one  exception to the unanimous judicial affirmation that tacit acceptance does not comply with Art II r 2 that being a decision of the Court of First Instance of Rotterdam The learned author said that this decision was not in conformity with either the text of Art II r 2 or the intent of its drafters and noted that the decision had been rightly criticised Significantly he referred to the history of Art II r 2 which confirmed that the drafters of the New York Convention wished to exclude from its scope oral or tacit acceptance of a written proposal to arbitrate In his article Is the need for writing as expressed in the New York Convention and the Model Law out of step with commercial practice   1996 International Arbitration vol 12 no 1 p 27 at 32 Neil Kaplan QC affirmed Prof van den Bergs interpretation Mr Kaplan referred to discussions that he had had with Prof Pieter Sanders the Dutch delegate in the drafting of the Convention who had given him the actual minutes of the delegates consideration of Prof Sanders proposal to add to the draft of Art II r 2 the following words   Confirmation in writing by one of the parties which is kept without contestation by the party UN DOC ECONF 26L54   The English and USSR delegates at the drafting session objected to that proposal and it was rejected van den Berg op cit at 196 Kaplan op cit 3233 Earlier as Kaplan J he had held in the High Court of Hong Kong in H Smal Limited v Goldroyce Garment Limited 1994 2 HKC 526 HCMP000 9081994 that there was no basis for arguing that an arbitration agreement could be established by a course of dealing or the conduct of the parties under Art VII of the Model Law see Schedule 2 to the International Arbitration Act 1974 Cth Kaplan J said that he had looked at the UNCITRAL reports in relation to Art VII and was quite satisfied that it could not be complied with unless there was a record in which the defendant in writing assented to the agreement to arbitrate see at 12 It has been recognized that a national courts in the interest of uniformity should construe rules formulated by an international convention especially rules formulated for the purpose of governing international transactions such as the hire of vessels or the carriage of goods in a normal manner appropriate for the interpretation of an international convention unconstrained by technical rules of English or domestic law or by English or domestic legal precedent but on broad principles of general acceptation Shipping Corporation of India Ltd v Gamlen Chemical Co Australasia Pty Ltd 1980 HCA 51  1980 147

MV Sky Reefer 515 US 528 at 537 1995 per Kennedy J Renquist CJ Scalia Souter Thomas and Ginsberg JJ agreeing Mason and Wilson JJ went on to say 147 CLR at 159   It is important that we should adhere to this approach when we are interpreting rules which have been formulated for the purpose of regulating the rights and liabilities of parties to international mercantile transactions where great store is set upon certainty and uniformity of application see too Great China Metal Industries Ltd v Malayasian International Shipping Corporation Berhad 1998 HCA 65  1988 196 CLR 161 at 186 71 per McHugh J   It is also important in construing international conventions that the views taken by courts particularly the Supreme Courts of nations are kept in mind so that there can be consistency in interpretation And I am conscious that in s 31 of the International Arbitration Act 1974 Cth the definition of arbitration agreement is that it is an agreement of the kind referred to in Art II r 2 As a matter of construction under Australian law I would have no hesitation in concluding that the definition was inclusive one However I think that the drafting of the definition in Art II r 2 invokes a concept of certainty that the arbitration clause or arbitration agreement is itself signed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams The precontractual exchanges of telexes and emails cannot themselves convert into separate or freestanding agreements in the present case unless and until the vessel was actually agreed to be fixed It was only upon the agreement to fix the vessel that it could be said to be under charter And as Capt Piperakis said he had imposed an absolute condition that a bank guarantee be provided The owners were not prepared to deliver the vessel on the evidence before me unless and until the bank guarantee had been received and it was at that point that they agreed that they were contractually bound That agreement which thus brought cl 45b into existence as an agreement to arbitrate was manifested by Comandate Marines conduct either in accepting the bank guarantee or later delivering the vessel At common law a recap telex can be found to contain a charter party including an arbitration clause which is incorporated by reference to an earlier telex or other communication even though both parties have not executed it The Epsilon Rosa 2003 2 Lloyds Rep 509 at 514 21 per Tuckey LJ May and Brooke LJJ agreeing But as Tuckey LJ pointed out 2003 2 Lloyds Rep at 515 29 one cannot generalize in these cases The act of acceptance which formed the contract was the provision of the bank guarantee And it is common ground that a formal charter party incorporating all of the agreed terms was to be prepared later by Prime on behalf of Comandate Marine Both parties were under a duty to cooperate to bring about the final form of their agreement in writing  Secured Income Real Estate Australia Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Limited 1979 HCA 51  1979 144 CLR 596 at 607 per Mason J applying Butt v MDonald 1896 7 QLJ 68 at 7071 per Griffith CJ No doubt cl 45b was part of the agreement between Pan and Comandate Marine But that does not of itself comply with Art II r 2 Rather the critical part of the conduct by which the contract was formed was the provision by a third party of the bank guarantee which brought the contract into existence So the contract being or including the arbitration agreement was not made by being signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of telexes or emails The contract included the conduct of the provision of the bank guarantee which fell outside the scope of Art II r 2 And because there is no evidence of any further written communication relied on as amounting to a document capable of being part of an exchange of letters or telegrams including telexes or emails then this series of communications does not satisfy the requirements of Art II r 2 A contract can be made by conduct evidencing a manifestation of assent to an offer Empirnall Holdings Pty Limited v Machon Paull Partners Pty Limited 1988 14 NSWLR 523 at 534535 per McHugh JA Samuels JA agreeing at 531 Accordingly I am of opinion that the telex from Prime to Mr Colaco headed FINAL RECAP was an offer by Comandate Marine to charter the vessel on the terms there set out and incorporated by reference which was capable of acceptance only by the provision of the bank guarantee For the reasons I have given based on the fairly settled interpretation of Art II r 2 that tacit acceptance is insufficient on the evidence I find that at the present time there is no agreement in writing for the purposes of Art II r 2 of the New York Convention  COMANDATE MARINES ALTERNATIVE CLAIM FOR STAY UNDER S 53 OF THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION ACT 1984 NSW   Comandate Marine argued that if an agreement in writing for the purposes of s 72 of the International Arbitration Act 1974 Cth were not found I should grant a stay pursuant to s 53 of the Commercial Arbitration Act 1984 NSW The Commercial Arbitration Act 1984 NSW provides that an arbitration agreement  means an agreement in writing to refer present or future disputes to arbitration see s 41 By s 531 the Court may stay the proceedings if it is satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration in accordance with the agreement and that the applicant was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration Having regard to the fact that Comandate Marine commenced its proceedings in rem as I have found without seeking to enforce any claim to arbitrate in those proceedings I am of opinion that the evidence establishes that Comandate Marine was not then ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration However its application for stay is made in Pans proceedings At the time when Pans proceedings were commenced Comandate Marine was pursuing the arbitration proceedings and still seeks to do so now I do not think that makes the commencement of the proceedings in rem irrelevant By s 532  the leave of the Court is required in the proceedings which have been commenced where the applicant for stay has delivered pleadings or taken any other steps in the proceedings other than the entry of an appearance Although Comandate Marines proceedings in rem were in separate proceedings they form as I have held part of the same matter for the purposes of ss 75 and 76 of the Constitution  and I am not minded to exercise any discretion in favour of Comandate Marine having regard to its conduct in taking the in rem proceedings in the circumstances which I have found  SCOPE OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE   Comandate Marine argued that the claims brought under ss 51A  52 and 55A of the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth and seeking relief under ss 82 and 87  including relief setting aside ab initio the charter party and preventing Comandate Marine from enforcing against the plaintiff any arbitral award were colourable It was not put that the claims were an abuse of the process of the Court Rather it was put in oral argument that there had been a misuse of s 12 of the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth because the very complaints the subject of the claims under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth were in essence the same as the breaches of contract relied on by Pan Comandate Marine in written submissions asserted that the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth claims had been made for the improper purpose of fabricating jurisdiction I do not think this argument has any substance Part V of the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth in which s 52 is found sets out a statutory norm of conduct to which corporations must conform in trade or commerce The task of the Court is to apply such norms where they arise in litigation even where the outcome is not materially different to applying the common law of negligence as in Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree 2005 HCA 69  2005 80 ALJR 183 at 191 29 per Gleeson CJ or of passing off as in Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd 2000 HCA 12  2000 202 CLR 45 at 83 97  In the latter case the whole court approved what Mason J had said in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd 1982 HCA 44  1982 149 CLR 191 at 205 see 202 CLR at 83 97 in the following terms   Likewise the operation of s 52 is not restricted by the common law principles relating to passingoff If as I consider the section provides the public with wider protection from deception than the common law it does not follow that there is a conflict between the section and the common law The statute provides an additional remedy  emphasis added   I am of opinion that the statutory remedy relied on by Pan is additional to whatever contractual remedies may be available to it and that there is no basis for the attribution to Pan of any improper purpose to fabricate jurisdiction The Parliament of the Commonwealth has enacted the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth under the trade and commerce power in s 51i of the Constitution  There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Pan has not properly and regularly invoked the Courts jurisdiction Pans pleading raises an issue of substance as to whether or not Comandate Marine engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct I am satisfied that this is truly part of the one controversy which the Court has been asked to quell cf DOrta Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid 2005 HCA 12  2005 79 ALJR 755 at 761 32  The only arguable limitation in the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth which might be seen as restricting the jurisdiction or powers any court invested with jurisdiction under that Act is to be found in s 13 But on examination s 13 does not affect the jurisdiction which a court including this Court has from sources other than the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth itself Rather s 13 provides that the Act does not confer on or invest jurisdiction on or in a court in a matter which is not of a kind mentioned in ss 76ii or iii of the Constitution  In ascertaining the scope of jurisdiction which the Federal Court may exercise s 13 thus provides some guidance It contemplates that matters of a kind mentioned in ss 76ii and iii of the Constitution can be within the jurisdiction of the Court Section 76iii of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction is a clear source of power to enact the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth itself and define maritime claims as well as associated matters of Admiralty and marine jurisdiction in ss 4 and 12  And s 76ii provides that the judicial power of the Commonwealth is invoked in any matter arising under any laws made by the Parliament The purpose of s 13 is to limit in the construction of the Act the conferral of jurisdiction by the Act to matters within the power of the Parliament and the judicial power of the Commonwealth It is not to limit the other powers of a court on or in which the Act confers or invests jurisdiction Clearly enough s 86 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth is a law made by the Parliament which confers jurisdiction on this Court independently of the jurisdiction conferred on it by the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth It is quite inappropriate to read provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court by making implications or imposing limitations which are not found in the express words Owners of Shin Kobe Maru v Empire Shipping Co Inc 1994 HCA 54  1994 181 CLR 404 at 421 see too Mansfield v Director of

Gleeson CJ Gummow Hayne and Crennan JJ see too Elbe Shipping SA v The Ship Global Peace 2006 FCA 954 at 138 per Allsop J see too at 6276 Comandate Marine also argued that a limitation was imposed on courts exercising jurisdiction conferred by the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth by s 31 But s 311 provides that the liability on a judgment of a relevant person defined by s 31 as a person who would be liable were the proceedings in personam brought against that person who has entered an appearance in a proceeding on a maritime claim commenced as an action in rem against a ship or property is not limited to the value of the ship or other property The section confirms the amplitude of the jurisdiction rather than restricts it Next Comandate Marine argued that a relevant person who appears in proceedings commenced by a writ in rem cannot be sued in proceedings in personam in this Court in respect of matters outside the relief claimed in the writ in rem on a cause of action other than a maritime claim within the meaning of s 4 of the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth or on associated matters of admiralty and marine jurisdiction within the meaning of s 12 of that Act Here part of the matter within the meaning of ss 76ii and iii of the Constitution  is the controversy between the parties under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth which Pan has pleaded The judicial power of the Commonwealth is exercised in resolving such matters Here the controversy involves claims under two Acts of the Parliament each of which specifically and independently one of the other confers jurisdiction on this Court Accordingly I am of opinion that this Court does have jurisdiction to hear and determine such an in personam proceeding as this That is not to say however that the ship or property the subject of the writ in rem will be available necessarily to answer any judgment for any in personam claim against a relevant person such as one under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth which is neither a maritime claim or an associated matter within the meaning of ss 4 or 12  I am of opinion that the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth cannot be construed as in any way limiting the jurisdiction of this Court to hear and determine any matter within its jurisdiction Rather appositely to the present proceedings there may be a question at the trial as to the availability of the bank guarantee which Comandate Marine provided as security in lieu of the ship Comandate to satisfy a claim made by Pan which is not within ss 4 or 12 of the Act Pans claim in personam for relief under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth is not invalid and its proceedings in personam are not invalidated by that claim s 51 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 Cth The Court at the final hearing can address any injustice which might arise if Comandate Marine wishes then to agitate such matters including whether the security provided should be available to satisfy any claim under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth The Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth provides Pan with remedies different to any remedy that could be awarded in pursuance of its contract claims Indeed one of the remedies it seeks is the avoidance of the contract

06_1112.xml,c16,discussed,H Smal Limited v Goldroyce Garment Limited [1994] 2 HKC 526,As noted above Comandate Marines proceedings in rem contained no such request And Art 81 of the Model Law relevantly requires a court in which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement to refer the parties to arbitration if a party so requests no later than when submitting its first statement on the substance of the dispute 59 Russell on Arbitration 22 nd ed at 610 A5018 refers to Art 81 having the same effect as English law ie the party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement must apply to the court without delay for a stay of the proceedings op cit at 296 7005 The position is similar under s 532 of the Commercial Arbitration Act 1984 NSW which applies here by force of s 79 of the Judiciary Act 1903 Cth Comandate Marine did not apply to have its proceedings referred to arbitration when they were before this Court or the High Court I am of opinion that Comandate Marines conduct in bringing its proceedings in rem was incompatible with the arbitration agreement and that Art 81 and Art 9 of the Model Law do not avail it Comandate Marine is in a similar position to that of the landlord in the example given by Parker J in Matthews v Smallwood 1910 1 Ch at 786787 By pleading the writ in the way which it did Comandate Marine exercised a right of action given by the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth to litigate the breach of the charter party as a general maritime claim under s 43f of the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth in this Court I am of opinion that in choosing to claim only that relief when it invoked the jurisdiction of the Court Comandate Marine could not do that without prejudice to any right it might otherwise have had to seek security for the arbitration under s 29 at a later stage It made no such claim in the writ and it procured the arrest of the vessel for the purposes of the particular relief which it claimed in the writ The way in which Comandate Marine framed its claim in the writ nailed its colours to the mast as much as the warrant for arrest later was nailed notionally or actually to the mast of the Boomerang I  Having invoked the jurisdiction of the Court to procure the arrest of the vessel in order to pursue the only claims it pleaded it is not open to Comandate Marine now to say that it did so without prejudice to any right later to apply for security under s 29 of the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth In its report Civil Admiralty Jurisdiction Report No 33 1986 Law Reform Commission Australia the Commission recommended the introduction of what has become s 29 so as to enable the Admiralty jurisdiction to be used to obtain and retain security even though the merits of the dispute are to be determined elsewhere if the subject matter of the dispute lies within Admiralty jurisdiction The Commission noted that such a solution would do most to ensure that the award of the tribunal that decides upon the merits is satisfied and hence that a just result would be obtained It noted that the law had a strong interest in compliance with arbitral awards duly made and in achieving cooperation between courts and arbitrators to this end However the Commission desired in the solution it proposed that the Court should retain a discretion to stay or to exercise jurisdiction to decide the merits ALRC 33 189 That discretion was to arise in the Court being able to take into account all relevant circumstances although the Commission noted that as at 1986 English and South African courts required the plaintiff to demonstrate why the assistance of a court was required in retaining security although there were shades of difference between the readiness of the respective jurisdictions to assist in respect of claims otherwise unconnected with the forum The Tuyuti 1984 QB 838 at 851 Katagum Wholesale Commodities v The MV Paz 1984 3 SAf LR 261 at 268 270 Natal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa Neither party argued that the analysis of the present question should be approached on the basis that there had been a contract of abandonment such as in Paal Wilson  Co AS v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal 1983 1 AC 854 at 915916 There Lord Diplock considered that abandonment of a contract which was still executory involved the formation of a contract of abandonment in which each party promised to release the other from performance of all further obligations including the obligation to pay damages for past breaches arising under the executory and now abandoned contract Lord Brandon of Oakbrook who gave the leading speech see 1983 1 AC 900C per Lord Diplock said that the question of whether a contract has been abandoned or not is one of fact 1983 1 AC at 913F He continued 1983 1 AC at 914AC   The concept of the implied abandonment of a contract as a result of the conduct of the parties to it is well established in law  see Chitty on Contracts  23 rd ed 1968 vol 1 p 577 para 1231 and cases there cited Where A seeks to prove that he and B have abandoned a contract in this way there are two ways in which A can put his case The first way is by showing that the conduct of each party as evinced to the other party and acted on by him leads necessarily to the inference of an implied agreement between them to abandon the contract The second method is by showing that the conduct of B as evinced towards A has been such as to lead A reasonably to believe that B has abandoned the contract even though it has not in fact been Bs intention to do so and that A has significantly altered his position in reliance on that belief The first method involves actual abandonment by both A and B The second method involves the creation by B of a situation in which he is estopped from asserting as against A that he B has not abandoned the contract  Pearl Mill Co v Ivy Tannery Co Ltd 1919 1 KB 78    This contractual analysis is inapposite here but their Lordships approach shows that notwithstanding that arbitration proceedings have been regularly commenced and that both parties are bound to their pursuit the conduct of one party or both parties can bring about the legal consequence that the parties obligations to arbitrate in the arbitration proceedings have become abandoned or inoperative or incapable of being performed In international trade and commerce it is critical that the courts respect and enforce arbitration agreements where they exist in accordance with in particular the New York Convention and legislation designed to give effect to it such as the International Arbitration Act 1974 Cth This is because in international trade and commerce the parties generally will not wish to be subject to serendipity of where a ship may be arrested an action begun or damage occur to determine a forum of any litigation between them or the substantive law to be applied to their dispute The parties will be conscious that an accident or fortuity may occur at any point in a voyage or flight and very different legal results may flow depending on which law and which forum determine their dispute It is for this reason that arbitration clauses such as cl 45b invoking arbitration in London under English law have been a popular recourse for parties in international trade for over a century Nowadays other centres of commercial arbitration including Australia are recognized as providing sound and fair fora and laws for the resolution of disputes in international trade or commerce However the Court should be astute to uphold and enforce agreements such as those in cl 45b rather than to display a form of judicial prejudice or xenophobia against the parties chosen method or place of dispute resolution Refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate in international transactions is capable of undermining the reasonable but significant expectations of the international commercial community and the confidence which it and indeed local business people place in the readiness of courts to hold people to their bargains see eg Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v MV Sky Reefer 515 US 528 at 538 1995 Mitsubishi Motors Corp

which their disputes will be resolved by use of an arbitration agreement such as in cl 45b so they may also choose to give up their rights to use that method or they may so conduct themselves that the choice will be attributed to them by the doctrine of election When Comandate Marine chose to begin its in rem proceedings in the form which it utilized it brought about the consequence that it was taken to have elected not to pursue its arbitration proceedings It may have chosen another method to seek security by framing the relief it sought in its writ in a different way but it did not do so The English authorities on which Comandate Marine relied and to which Sheppard J referred did not consider the question of whether the party seeking security had made an election For that reason I think those authorities are distinguishable Because Comandate Marine elected to litigate the dispute and Pan has too the arbitration agreement in cl 45b has been in substance abandoned or for the purposes of s 75 of the International Arbitration Act 1974 Cth rendered inoperative or incapable of being performed  WAS THERE AN AGREEMENT IN WRITING   Pan argues that Art II r 2 of the New York Convention requires there to be either an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement which is either signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams Pan says that where the contract was formed as it argues the charter party was in this case either by acts or conduct Art II r 2 is not satisfied Pan says that each of the provision of the bank guarantee or the delivery of the vessel was an act or amounted to conduct which brought the contract into existence In support of the argument it relies on decision of the Supreme Court of Italy in Robobar Limited v Finncold SaS 1995 Year Book Comm Arbn XX 739 at 740 The Court held that where a purchase confirmation had been sent by the party seeking to rely on the arbitration clause to which the other party had not responded there was no doubt that none of the formalities in Art II in the New York Convention had been met because the clause was only contained in the confirmation to which the other party had not agreed by letter or telegram Pan also relied on a decision of the Court of Appeal of the Federal Republic of Germany in a case between a Dutch seller and a German buyer 1997 Year Book Comm Arbn Vol II 237 at 238 The Court of Appeal held that a declaration in writing of both sides to the contract was required A one sided confirmation did not suffice and the lack of declaration in writing by the other party could not be cured by that partys appearance in the arbitration In this matter however the critical telex of 20 April 2006 commenced by being in form a confirmation but ended with a request being made to both parties to confirm that the above recap was in line with the negotiations agreed so far The next relevant correspondence was the telex later that day noting that the bank guarantee had been received and indicating when delivery would occur I think this does fall within the positions contemplated by the Supreme Court of Italy and the German Court of Appeal as being ones in which the contract was not formed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams And In Zambia Steel  Building Supplies Ltd v James Clark  Eaton Ltd 1986 2 Lloyds Rep 225 at 234 Ralph Gibson LJ said   It is clear to me that the New York Convention by Art II par 2 did not impose upon the contracting state an obligation to recognise an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration unless it is signed by the parties or unless the agreement is contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams in the sense that the assent to be bound by both parties is given in writing by such document    The Manitoba Court of Appeal noted in Proctor v Schellenberg 2003 2 WWR 621 at 628 18 that Art IV r 1b of the New York Convention requires a party seeking to obtain recognition and enforcement of an award to provide the original agreement referred to in article II or a duly certified copy thereof They said that  there had to be a record to evidence the agreement of the parties to resolve the dispute by arbitral process in concluding that facsimile transmissions were sufficient to be or form part of an agreement in writing In AJ van den Bergs The New York Arbitration Convention of 1958 1981 at 196198 206 277 the learned author notes that Art II r 2 excludes oral or tacit acceptance and concluded at 197 227 that as at 1981 there had been only one  exception to the unanimous judicial affirmation that tacit acceptance does not comply with Art II r 2 that being a decision of the Court of First Instance of Rotterdam The learned author said that this decision was not in conformity with either the text of Art II r 2 or the intent of its drafters and noted that the decision had been rightly criticised Significantly he referred to the history of Art II r 2 which confirmed that the drafters of the New York Convention wished to exclude from its scope oral or tacit acceptance of a written proposal to arbitrate In his article Is the need for writing as expressed in the New York Convention and the Model Law out of step with commercial practice   1996 International Arbitration vol 12 no 1 p 27 at 32 Neil Kaplan QC affirmed Prof van den Bergs interpretation Mr Kaplan referred to discussions that he had had with Prof Pieter Sanders the Dutch delegate in the drafting of the Convention who had given him the actual minutes of the delegates consideration of Prof Sanders proposal to add to the draft of Art II r 2 the following words   Confirmation in writing by one of the parties which is kept without contestation by the party UN DOC ECONF 26L54   The English and USSR delegates at the drafting session objected to that proposal and it was rejected van den Berg op cit at 196 Kaplan op cit 3233 Earlier as Kaplan J he had held in the High Court of Hong Kong in H Smal Limited v Goldroyce Garment Limited 1994 2 HKC 526 HCMP000 9081994 that there was no basis for arguing that an arbitration agreement could be established by a course of dealing or the conduct of the parties under Art VII of the Model Law see Schedule 2 to the International Arbitration Act 1974 Cth Kaplan J said that he had looked at the UNCITRAL reports in relation to Art VII and was quite satisfied that it could not be complied with unless there was a record in which the defendant in writing assented to the agreement to arbitrate see at 12 It has been recognized that a national courts in the interest of uniformity should construe rules formulated by an international convention especially rules formulated for the purpose of governing international transactions such as the hire of vessels or the carriage of goods in a normal manner appropriate for the interpretation of an international convention unconstrained by technical rules of English or domestic law or by English or domestic legal precedent but on broad principles of general acceptation Shipping Corporation of India Ltd v Gamlen Chemical Co Australasia Pty Ltd 1980 HCA 51  1980 147 CLR 142 at 159 per Mason and

537 1995 per Kennedy J Renquist CJ Scalia Souter Thomas and Ginsberg JJ agreeing Mason and Wilson JJ went on to say 147 CLR at 159   It is important that we should adhere to this approach when we are interpreting rules which have been formulated for the purpose of regulating the rights and liabilities of parties to international mercantile transactions where great store is set upon certainty and uniformity of application see too Great China Metal Industries Ltd v Malayasian International Shipping Corporation Berhad 1998 HCA 65  1988 196 CLR 161 at 186 71 per McHugh J   It is also important in construing international conventions that the views taken by courts particularly the Supreme Courts of nations are kept in mind so that there can be consistency in interpretation And I am conscious that in s 31 of the International Arbitration Act 1974 Cth the definition of arbitration agreement is that it is an agreement of the kind referred to in Art II r 2 As a matter of construction under Australian law I would have no hesitation in concluding that the definition was inclusive one However I think that the drafting of the definition in Art II r 2 invokes a concept of certainty that the arbitration clause or arbitration agreement is itself signed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams The precontractual exchanges of telexes and emails cannot themselves convert into separate or freestanding agreements in the present case unless and until the vessel was actually agreed to be fixed It was only upon the agreement to fix the vessel that it could be said to be under charter And as Capt Piperakis said he had imposed an absolute condition that a bank guarantee be provided The owners were not prepared to deliver the vessel on the evidence before me unless and until the bank guarantee had been received and it was at that point that they agreed that they were contractually bound That agreement which thus brought cl 45b into existence as an agreement to arbitrate was manifested by Comandate Marines conduct either in accepting the bank guarantee or later delivering the vessel At common law a recap telex can be found to contain a charter party including an arbitration clause which is incorporated by reference to an earlier telex or other communication even though both parties have not executed it The Epsilon Rosa 2003 2 Lloyds Rep 509 at 514 21 per Tuckey LJ May and Brooke LJJ agreeing But as Tuckey LJ pointed out 2003 2 Lloyds Rep at 515 29 one cannot generalize in these cases The act of acceptance which formed the contract was the provision of the bank guarantee And it is common ground that a formal charter party incorporating all of the agreed terms was to be prepared later by Prime on behalf of Comandate Marine Both parties were under a duty to cooperate to bring about the final form of their agreement in writing  Secured Income Real Estate Australia Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Limited 1979 HCA 51  1979 144 CLR 596 at 607 per Mason J applying Butt v MDonald 1896 7 QLJ 68 at 7071 per Griffith CJ No doubt cl 45b was part of the agreement between Pan and Comandate Marine But that does not of itself comply with Art II r 2 Rather the critical part of the conduct by which the contract was formed was the provision by a third party of the bank guarantee which brought the contract into existence So the contract being or including the arbitration agreement was not made by being signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of telexes or emails The contract included the conduct of the provision of the bank guarantee which fell outside the scope of Art II r 2 And because there is no evidence of any further written communication relied on as amounting to a document capable of being part of an exchange of letters or telegrams including telexes or emails then this series of communications does not satisfy the requirements of Art II r 2 A contract can be made by conduct evidencing a manifestation of assent to an offer Empirnall Holdings Pty Limited v Machon Paull Partners Pty Limited 1988 14 NSWLR 523 at 534535 per McHugh JA Samuels JA agreeing at 531 Accordingly I am of opinion that the telex from Prime to Mr Colaco headed FINAL RECAP was an offer by Comandate Marine to charter the vessel on the terms there set out and incorporated by reference which was capable of acceptance only by the provision of the bank guarantee For the reasons I have given based on the fairly settled interpretation of Art II r 2 that tacit acceptance is insufficient on the evidence I find that at the present time there is no agreement in writing for the purposes of Art II r 2 of the New York Convention  COMANDATE MARINES ALTERNATIVE CLAIM FOR STAY UNDER S 53 OF THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION ACT 1984 NSW   Comandate Marine argued that if an agreement in writing for the purposes of s 72 of the International Arbitration Act 1974 Cth were not found I should grant a stay pursuant to s 53 of the Commercial Arbitration Act 1984 NSW The Commercial Arbitration Act 1984 NSW provides that an arbitration agreement  means an agreement in writing to refer present or future disputes to arbitration see s 41 By s 531 the Court may stay the proceedings if it is satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration in accordance with the agreement and that the applicant was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration Having regard to the fact that Comandate Marine commenced its proceedings in rem as I have found without seeking to enforce any claim to arbitrate in those proceedings I am of opinion that the evidence establishes that Comandate Marine was not then ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration However its application for stay is made in Pans proceedings At the time when Pans proceedings were commenced Comandate Marine was pursuing the arbitration proceedings and still seeks to do so now I do not think that makes the commencement of the proceedings in rem irrelevant By s 532  the leave of the Court is required in the proceedings which have been commenced where the applicant for stay has delivered pleadings or taken any other steps in the proceedings other than the entry of an appearance Although Comandate Marines proceedings in rem were in separate proceedings they form as I have held part of the same matter for the purposes of ss 75 and 76 of the Constitution  and I am not minded to exercise any discretion in favour of Comandate Marine having regard to its conduct in taking the in rem proceedings in the circumstances which I have found  SCOPE OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE   Comandate Marine argued that the claims brought under ss 51A  52 and 55A of the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth and seeking relief under ss 82 and 87  including relief setting aside ab initio the charter party and preventing Comandate Marine from enforcing against the plaintiff any arbitral award were colourable It was not put that the claims were an abuse of the process of the Court Rather it was put in oral argument that there had been a misuse of s 12 of the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth because the very complaints the subject of the claims under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth were in essence the same as the breaches of contract relied on by Pan Comandate Marine in written submissions asserted that the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth claims had been made for the improper purpose of fabricating jurisdiction I do not think this argument has any substance Part V of the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth in which s 52 is found sets out a statutory norm of conduct to which corporations must conform in trade or commerce The task of the Court is to apply such norms where they arise in litigation even where the outcome is not materially different to applying the common law of negligence as in Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree 2005 HCA 69  2005 80 ALJR 183 at 191 29 per Gleeson CJ or of passing off as in Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd 2000 HCA 12  2000 202 CLR 45 at 83 97  In the latter case the whole court approved what Mason J had said in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd 1982 HCA 44  1982 149 CLR 191 at 205 see 202 CLR at 83 97 in the following terms   Likewise the operation of s 52 is not restricted by the common law principles relating to passingoff If as I consider the section provides the public with wider protection from deception than the common law it does not follow that there is a conflict between the section and the common law The statute provides an additional remedy  emphasis added   I am of opinion that the statutory remedy relied on by Pan is additional to whatever contractual remedies may be available to it and that there is no basis for the attribution to Pan of any improper purpose to fabricate jurisdiction The Parliament of the Commonwealth has enacted the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth under the trade and commerce power in s 51i of the Constitution  There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Pan has not properly and regularly invoked the Courts jurisdiction Pans pleading raises an issue of substance as to whether or not Comandate Marine engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct I am satisfied that this is truly part of the one controversy which the Court has been asked to quell cf DOrta Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid 2005 HCA 12  2005 79 ALJR 755 at 761 32  The only arguable limitation in the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth which might be seen as restricting the jurisdiction or powers any court invested with jurisdiction under that Act is to be found in s 13 But on examination s 13 does not affect the jurisdiction which a court including this Court has from sources other than the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth itself Rather s 13 provides that the Act does not confer on or invest jurisdiction on or in a court in a matter which is not of a kind mentioned in ss 76ii or iii of the Constitution  In ascertaining the scope of jurisdiction which the Federal Court may exercise s 13 thus provides some guidance It contemplates that matters of a kind mentioned in ss 76ii and iii of the Constitution can be within the jurisdiction of the Court Section 76iii of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction is a clear source of power to enact the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth itself and define maritime claims as well as associated matters of Admiralty and marine jurisdiction in ss 4 and 12  And s 76ii provides that the judicial power of the Commonwealth is invoked in any matter arising under any laws made by the Parliament The purpose of s 13 is to limit in the construction of the Act the conferral of jurisdiction by the Act to matters within the power of the Parliament and the judicial power of the Commonwealth It is not to limit the other powers of a court on or in which the Act confers or invests jurisdiction Clearly enough s 86 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth is a law made by the Parliament which confers jurisdiction on this Court independently of the jurisdiction conferred on it by the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth It is quite inappropriate to read provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court by making implications or imposing limitations which are not found in the express words Owners of Shin Kobe Maru v Empire Shipping Co Inc 1994 HCA 54  1994 181 CLR 404 at 421 see too Mansfield v Director of Public Prosecutions for Western Australia 2006 HCA 38 at 7  10 per Gleeson CJ Gummow Kirby Hayne and Crennan JJ Once the jurisdiction of this Court has been invoked the Court should exercise it  Re Wakim Ex parte McNally 1999 HCA 27  1999 198 CLR 511 at 588 149  even if it be to protect itself and its processes against their abuse cf Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority 2006 HCA 27 315 per Gleeson CJ Gummow Hayne and Crennan JJ see too Elbe Shipping SA v The Ship Global Peace 2006 FCA 954 at 138 per Allsop J see too at 6276 Comandate Marine also argued that a limitation was imposed on courts exercising jurisdiction conferred by the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth by s 31 But s 311 provides that the liability on a judgment of a relevant person defined by s 31 as a person who would be liable were the proceedings in personam brought against that person who has entered an appearance in a proceeding on a maritime claim commenced as an action in rem against a ship or property is not limited to the value of the ship or other property The section confirms the amplitude of the jurisdiction rather than restricts it Next Comandate Marine argued that a relevant person who appears in proceedings commenced by a writ in rem cannot be sued in proceedings in personam in this Court in respect of matters outside the relief claimed in the writ in rem on a cause of action other than a maritime claim within the meaning of s 4 of the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth or on associated matters of admiralty and marine jurisdiction within the meaning of s 12 of that Act Here part of the matter within the meaning of ss 76ii and iii of the Constitution  is the controversy between the parties under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth which Pan has pleaded The judicial power of the Commonwealth is exercised in resolving such matters Here the controversy involves claims under two Acts of the Parliament each of which specifically and independently one of the other confers jurisdiction on this Court Accordingly I am of opinion that this Court does have jurisdiction to hear and determine such an in personam proceeding as this That is not to say however that the ship or property the subject of the writ in rem will be available necessarily to answer any judgment for any in personam claim against a relevant person such as one under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth which is neither a maritime claim or an associated matter within the meaning of ss 4 or 12  I am of opinion that the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth cannot be construed as in any way limiting the jurisdiction of this Court to hear and determine any matter within its jurisdiction Rather appositely to the present proceedings there may be a question at the trial as to the availability of the bank guarantee which Comandate Marine provided as security in lieu of the ship Comandate to satisfy a claim made by Pan which is not within ss 4 or 12 of the Act Pans claim in personam for relief under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth is not invalid and its proceedings in personam are not invalidated by that claim s 51 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 Cth The Court at the final hearing can address any injustice which might arise if Comandate Marine wishes then to agitate such matters including whether the security provided should be available to satisfy any claim under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth The Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth provides Pan with remedies different to any remedy that could be awarded in pursuance of its contract claims Indeed one of the remedies it seeks is the avoidance of the contract not pursuant to contractual principles but by force of an order under s 87 of the Act Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Limited 2004 HCA 3  2004 216 CLR 388 at 409 52  And the High Court has emphasized that the remedies under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth are designed to give effect in cases of contravention of s 52  to the prescribed standards of conduct which are embodied in that section where activities occur in trade or commerce Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited 2000 HCA 12  2000 202 CLR 45 at 83 97  Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree 2005 HCA 69  2005 80 ALJR 183

06_1112.xml,c18,considered,Incitec Ltd v Alkimos Shipping Corporation [2004] FCA 698 ; (2004) 138 FCR 496,As noted above Comandate Marines proceedings in rem contained no such request And Art 81 of the Model Law relevantly requires a court in which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement to refer the parties to arbitration if a party so requests no later than when submitting its first statement on the substance of the dispute 59 Russell on Arbitration 22 nd ed at 610 A5018 refers to Art 81 having the same effect as English law ie the party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement must apply to the court without delay for a stay of the proceedings op cit at 296 7005 The position is similar under s 532 of the Commercial Arbitration Act 1984 NSW which applies here by force of s 79 of the Judiciary Act 1903 Cth Comandate Marine did not apply to have its proceedings referred to arbitration when they were before this Court or the High Court I am of opinion that Comandate Marines conduct in bringing its proceedings in rem was incompatible with the arbitration agreement and that Art 81 and Art 9 of the Model Law do not avail it Comandate Marine is in a similar position to that of the landlord in the example given by Parker J in Matthews v Smallwood 1910 1 Ch at 786787 By pleading the writ in the way which it did Comandate Marine exercised a right of action given by the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth to litigate the breach of the charter party as a general maritime claim under s 43f of the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth in this Court I am of opinion that in choosing to claim only that relief when it invoked the jurisdiction of the Court Comandate Marine could not do that without prejudice to any right it might otherwise have had to seek security for the arbitration under s 29 at a later stage It made no such claim in the writ and it procured the arrest of the vessel for the purposes of the particular relief which it claimed in the writ The way in which Comandate Marine framed its claim in the writ nailed its colours to the mast as much as the warrant for arrest later was nailed notionally or actually to the mast of the Boomerang I  Having invoked the jurisdiction of the Court to procure the arrest of the vessel in order to pursue the only claims it pleaded it is not open to Comandate Marine now to say that it did so without prejudice to any right later to apply for security under s 29 of the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth In its report Civil Admiralty Jurisdiction Report No 33 1986 Law Reform Commission Australia the Commission recommended the introduction of what has become s 29 so as to enable the Admiralty jurisdiction to be used to obtain and retain security even though the merits of the dispute are to be determined elsewhere if the subject matter of the dispute lies within Admiralty jurisdiction The Commission noted that such a solution would do most to ensure that the award of the tribunal that decides upon the merits is satisfied and hence that a just result would be obtained It noted that the law had a strong interest in compliance with arbitral awards duly made and in achieving cooperation between courts and arbitrators to this end However the Commission desired in the solution it proposed that the Court should retain a discretion to stay or to exercise jurisdiction to decide the merits ALRC 33 189 That discretion was to arise in the Court being able to take into account all relevant circumstances although the Commission noted that as at 1986 English and South African courts required the plaintiff to demonstrate why the assistance of a court was required in retaining security although there were shades of difference between the readiness of the respective jurisdictions to assist in respect of claims otherwise unconnected with the forum The Tuyuti 1984 QB 838 at 851 Katagum Wholesale Commodities v The MV Paz 1984 3 SAf LR 261 at 268 270 Natal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa Neither party argued that the analysis of the present question should be approached on the basis that there had been a contract of abandonment such as in Paal Wilson  Co AS v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal 1983 1 AC 854 at 915916 There Lord Diplock considered that abandonment of a contract which was still executory involved the formation of a contract of abandonment in which each party promised to release the other from performance of all further obligations including the obligation to pay damages for past breaches arising under the executory and now abandoned contract Lord Brandon of Oakbrook who gave the leading speech see 1983 1 AC 900C per Lord Diplock said that the question of whether a contract has been abandoned or not is one of fact 1983 1 AC at 913F He continued 1983 1 AC at 914AC   The concept of the implied abandonment of a contract as a result of the conduct of the parties to it is well established in law  see Chitty on Contracts  23 rd ed 1968 vol 1 p 577 para 1231 and cases there cited Where A seeks to prove that he and B have abandoned a contract in this way there are two ways in which A can put his case The first way is by showing that the conduct of each party as evinced to the other party and acted on by him leads necessarily to the inference of an implied agreement between them to abandon the contract The second method is by showing that the conduct of B as evinced towards A has been such as to lead A reasonably to believe that B has abandoned the contract even though it has not in fact been Bs intention to do so and that A has significantly altered his position in reliance on that belief The first method involves actual abandonment by both A and B The second method involves the creation by B of a situation in which he is estopped from asserting as against A that he B has not abandoned the contract  Pearl Mill Co v Ivy Tannery Co Ltd 1919 1 KB 78    This contractual analysis is inapposite here but their Lordships approach shows that notwithstanding that arbitration proceedings have been regularly commenced and that both parties are bound to their pursuit the conduct of one party or both parties can bring about the legal consequence that the parties obligations to arbitrate in the arbitration proceedings have become abandoned or inoperative or incapable of being performed In international trade and commerce it is critical that the courts respect and enforce arbitration agreements where they exist in accordance with in particular the New York Convention and legislation designed to give effect to it such as the International Arbitration Act 1974 Cth This is because in international trade and commerce the parties generally will not wish to be subject to serendipity of where a ship may be arrested an action begun or damage occur to determine a forum of any litigation between them or the substantive law to be applied to their dispute The parties will be conscious that an accident or fortuity may occur at any point in a voyage or flight and very different legal results may flow depending on which law and which forum determine their dispute It is for this reason that arbitration clauses such as cl 45b invoking arbitration in London under English law have been a popular recourse for parties in international trade for over a century Nowadays other centres of commercial arbitration including Australia are recognized as providing sound and fair fora and laws for the resolution of disputes in international trade or commerce However the Court should be astute to uphold and enforce agreements such as those in cl 45b rather than to display a form of judicial prejudice or xenophobia against the parties chosen method or place of dispute resolution Refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate in international transactions is capable of undermining the reasonable but significant expectations of the international commercial community and the confidence which it and indeed local business people place in the readiness of courts to hold people to their bargains see eg Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v MV Sky Reefer 515 US 528 at 538 1995 Mitsubishi Motors Corp

which their disputes will be resolved by use of an arbitration agreement such as in cl 45b so they may also choose to give up their rights to use that method or they may so conduct themselves that the choice will be attributed to them by the doctrine of election When Comandate Marine chose to begin its in rem proceedings in the form which it utilized it brought about the consequence that it was taken to have elected not to pursue its arbitration proceedings It may have chosen another method to seek security by framing the relief it sought in its writ in a different way but it did not do so The English authorities on which Comandate Marine relied and to which Sheppard J referred did not consider the question of whether the party seeking security had made an election For that reason I think those authorities are distinguishable Because Comandate Marine elected to litigate the dispute and Pan has too the arbitration agreement in cl 45b has been in substance abandoned or for the purposes of s 75 of the International Arbitration Act 1974 Cth rendered inoperative or incapable of being performed  WAS THERE AN AGREEMENT IN WRITING   Pan argues that Art II r 2 of the New York Convention requires there to be either an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement which is either signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams Pan says that where the contract was formed as it argues the charter party was in this case either by acts or conduct Art II r 2 is not satisfied Pan says that each of the provision of the bank guarantee or the delivery of the vessel was an act or amounted to conduct which brought the contract into existence In support of the argument it relies on decision of the Supreme Court of Italy in Robobar Limited v Finncold SaS 1995 Year Book Comm Arbn XX 739 at 740 The Court held that where a purchase confirmation had been sent by the party seeking to rely on the arbitration clause to which the other party had not responded there was no doubt that none of the formalities in Art II in the New York Convention had been met because the clause was only contained in the confirmation to which the other party had not agreed by letter or telegram Pan also relied on a decision of the Court of Appeal of the Federal Republic of Germany in a case between a Dutch seller and a German buyer 1997 Year Book Comm Arbn Vol II 237 at 238 The Court of Appeal held that a declaration in writing of both sides to the contract was required A one sided confirmation did not suffice and the lack of declaration in writing by the other party could not be cured by that partys appearance in the arbitration In this matter however the critical telex of 20 April 2006 commenced by being in form a confirmation but ended with a request being made to both parties to confirm that the above recap was in line with the negotiations agreed so far The next relevant correspondence was the telex later that day noting that the bank guarantee had been received and indicating when delivery would occur I think this does fall within the positions contemplated by the Supreme Court of Italy and the German Court of Appeal as being ones in which the contract was not formed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams And In Zambia Steel  Building Supplies Ltd v James Clark  Eaton Ltd 1986 2 Lloyds Rep 225 at 234 Ralph Gibson LJ said   It is clear to me that the New York Convention by Art II par 2 did not impose upon the contracting state an obligation to recognise an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration unless it is signed by the parties or unless the agreement is contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams in the sense that the assent to be bound by both parties is given in writing by such document    The Manitoba Court of Appeal noted in Proctor v Schellenberg 2003 2 WWR 621 at 628 18 that Art IV r 1b of the New York Convention requires a party seeking to obtain recognition and enforcement of an award to provide the original agreement referred to in article II or a duly certified copy thereof They said that  there had to be a record to evidence the agreement of the parties to resolve the dispute by arbitral process in concluding that facsimile transmissions were sufficient to be or form part of an agreement in writing In AJ van den Bergs The New York Arbitration Convention of 1958 1981 at 196198 206 277 the learned author notes that Art II r 2 excludes oral or tacit acceptance and concluded at 197 227 that as at 1981 there had been only one  exception to the unanimous judicial affirmation that tacit acceptance does not comply with Art II r 2 that being a decision of the Court of First Instance of Rotterdam The learned author said that this decision was not in conformity with either the text of Art II r 2 or the intent of its drafters and noted that the decision had been rightly criticised Significantly he referred to the history of Art II r 2 which confirmed that the drafters of the New York Convention wished to exclude from its scope oral or tacit acceptance of a written proposal to arbitrate In his article Is the need for writing as expressed in the New York Convention and the Model Law out of step with commercial practice   1996 International Arbitration vol 12 no 1 p 27 at 32 Neil Kaplan QC affirmed Prof van den Bergs interpretation Mr Kaplan referred to discussions that he had had with Prof Pieter Sanders the Dutch delegate in the drafting of the Convention who had given him the actual minutes of the delegates consideration of Prof Sanders proposal to add to the draft of Art II r 2 the following words   Confirmation in writing by one of the parties which is kept without contestation by the party UN DOC ECONF 26L54   The English and USSR delegates at the drafting session objected to that proposal and it was rejected van den Berg op cit at 196 Kaplan op cit 3233 Earlier as Kaplan J he had held in the High Court of Hong Kong in H Smal Limited v Goldroyce Garment Limited 1994 2 HKC 526 HCMP000 9081994 that there was no basis for arguing that an arbitration agreement could be established by a course of dealing or the conduct of the parties under Art VII of the Model Law see Schedule 2 to the International Arbitration Act 1974 Cth Kaplan J said that he had looked at the UNCITRAL reports in relation to Art VII and was quite satisfied that it could not be complied with unless there was a record in which the defendant in writing assented to the agreement to arbitrate see at 12 It has been recognized that a national courts in the interest of uniformity should construe rules formulated by an international convention especially rules formulated for the purpose of governing international transactions such as the hire of vessels or the carriage of goods in a normal manner appropriate for the interpretation of an international convention unconstrained by technical rules of English or domestic law or by English or domestic legal precedent but on broad principles of general acceptation Shipping Corporation of India Ltd v Gamlen Chemical Co Australasia Pty Ltd 1980 HCA 51  1980 147 CLR 142 at 159 per Mason and

537 1995 per Kennedy J Renquist CJ Scalia Souter Thomas and Ginsberg JJ agreeing Mason and Wilson JJ went on to say 147 CLR at 159   It is important that we should adhere to this approach when we are interpreting rules which have been formulated for the purpose of regulating the rights and liabilities of parties to international mercantile transactions where great store is set upon certainty and uniformity of application see too Great China Metal Industries Ltd v Malayasian International Shipping Corporation Berhad 1998 HCA 65  1988 196 CLR 161 at 186 71 per McHugh J   It is also important in construing international conventions that the views taken by courts particularly the Supreme Courts of nations are kept in mind so that there can be consistency in interpretation And I am conscious that in s 31 of the International Arbitration Act 1974 Cth the definition of arbitration agreement is that it is an agreement of the kind referred to in Art II r 2 As a matter of construction under Australian law I would have no hesitation in concluding that the definition was inclusive one However I think that the drafting of the definition in Art II r 2 invokes a concept of certainty that the arbitration clause or arbitration agreement is itself signed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams The precontractual exchanges of telexes and emails cannot themselves convert into separate or freestanding agreements in the present case unless and until the vessel was actually agreed to be fixed It was only upon the agreement to fix the vessel that it could be said to be under charter And as Capt Piperakis said he had imposed an absolute condition that a bank guarantee be provided The owners were not prepared to deliver the vessel on the evidence before me unless and until the bank guarantee had been received and it was at that point that they agreed that they were contractually bound That agreement which thus brought cl 45b into existence as an agreement to arbitrate was manifested by Comandate Marines conduct either in accepting the bank guarantee or later delivering the vessel At common law a recap telex can be found to contain a charter party including an arbitration clause which is incorporated by reference to an earlier telex or other communication even though both parties have not executed it The Epsilon Rosa 2003 2 Lloyds Rep 509 at 514 21 per Tuckey LJ May and Brooke LJJ agreeing But as Tuckey LJ pointed out 2003 2 Lloyds Rep at 515 29 one cannot generalize in these cases The act of acceptance which formed the contract was the provision of the bank guarantee And it is common ground that a formal charter party incorporating all of the agreed terms was to be prepared later by Prime on behalf of Comandate Marine Both parties were under a duty to cooperate to bring about the final form of their agreement in writing  Secured Income Real Estate Australia Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Limited 1979 HCA 51  1979 144 CLR 596 at 607 per Mason J applying Butt v MDonald 1896 7 QLJ 68 at 7071 per Griffith CJ No doubt cl 45b was part of the agreement between Pan and Comandate Marine But that does not of itself comply with Art II r 2 Rather the critical part of the conduct by which the contract was formed was the provision by a third party of the bank guarantee which brought the contract into existence So the contract being or including the arbitration agreement was not made by being signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of telexes or emails The contract included the conduct of the provision of the bank guarantee which fell outside the scope of Art II r 2 And because there is no evidence of any further written communication relied on as amounting to a document capable of being part of an exchange of letters or telegrams including telexes or emails then this series of communications does not satisfy the requirements of Art II r 2 A contract can be made by conduct evidencing a manifestation of assent to an offer Empirnall Holdings Pty Limited v Machon Paull Partners Pty Limited 1988 14 NSWLR 523 at 534535 per McHugh JA Samuels JA agreeing at 531 Accordingly I am of opinion that the telex from Prime to Mr Colaco headed FINAL RECAP was an offer by Comandate Marine to charter the vessel on the terms there set out and incorporated by reference which was capable of acceptance only by the provision of the bank guarantee For the reasons I have given based on the fairly settled interpretation of Art II r 2 that tacit acceptance is insufficient on the evidence I find that at the present time there is no agreement in writing for the purposes of Art II r 2 of the New York Convention  COMANDATE MARINES ALTERNATIVE CLAIM FOR STAY UNDER S 53 OF THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION ACT 1984 NSW   Comandate Marine argued that if an agreement in writing for the purposes of s 72 of the International Arbitration Act 1974 Cth were not found I should grant a stay pursuant to s 53 of the Commercial Arbitration Act 1984 NSW The Commercial Arbitration Act 1984 NSW provides that an arbitration agreement  means an agreement in writing to refer present or future disputes to arbitration see s 41 By s 531 the Court may stay the proceedings if it is satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration in accordance with the agreement and that the applicant was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration Having regard to the fact that Comandate Marine commenced its proceedings in rem as I have found without seeking to enforce any claim to arbitrate in those proceedings I am of opinion that the evidence establishes that Comandate Marine was not then ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration However its application for stay is made in Pans proceedings At the time when Pans proceedings were commenced Comandate Marine was pursuing the arbitration proceedings and still seeks to do so now I do not think that makes the commencement of the proceedings in rem irrelevant By s 532  the leave of the Court is required in the proceedings which have been commenced where the applicant for stay has delivered pleadings or taken any other steps in the proceedings other than the entry of an appearance Although Comandate Marines proceedings in rem were in separate proceedings they form as I have held part of the same matter for the purposes of ss 75 and 76 of the Constitution  and I am not minded to exercise any discretion in favour of Comandate Marine having regard to its conduct in taking the in rem proceedings in the circumstances which I have found  SCOPE OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE   Comandate Marine argued that the claims brought under ss 51A  52 and 55A of the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth and seeking relief under ss 82 and 87  including relief setting aside ab initio the charter party and preventing Comandate Marine from enforcing against the plaintiff any arbitral award were colourable It was not put that the claims were an abuse of the process of the Court Rather it was put in oral argument that there had been a misuse of s 12 of the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth because the very complaints the subject of the claims under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth were in essence the same as the breaches of contract relied on by Pan Comandate Marine in written submissions asserted that the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth claims had been made for the improper purpose of fabricating jurisdiction I do not think this argument has any substance Part V of the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth in which s 52 is found sets out a statutory norm of conduct to which corporations must conform in trade or commerce The task of the Court is to apply such norms where they arise in litigation even where the outcome is not materially different to applying the common law of negligence as in Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree 2005 HCA 69  2005 80 ALJR 183 at 191 29 per Gleeson CJ or of passing off as in Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd 2000 HCA 12  2000 202 CLR 45 at 83 97  In the latter case the whole court approved what Mason J had said in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd 1982 HCA 44  1982 149 CLR 191 at 205 see 202 CLR at 83 97 in the following terms   Likewise the operation of s 52 is not restricted by the common law principles relating to passingoff If as I consider the section provides the public with wider protection from deception than the common law it does not follow that there is a conflict between the section and the common law The statute provides an additional remedy  emphasis added   I am of opinion that the statutory remedy relied on by Pan is additional to whatever contractual remedies may be available to it and that there is no basis for the attribution to Pan of any improper purpose to fabricate jurisdiction The Parliament of the Commonwealth has enacted the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth under the trade and commerce power in s 51i of the Constitution  There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Pan has not properly and regularly invoked the Courts jurisdiction Pans pleading raises an issue of substance as to whether or not Comandate Marine engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct I am satisfied that this is truly part of the one controversy which the Court has been asked to quell cf DOrta Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid 2005 HCA 12  2005 79 ALJR 755 at 761 32  The only arguable limitation in the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth which might be seen as restricting the jurisdiction or powers any court invested with jurisdiction under that Act is to be found in s 13 But on examination s 13 does not affect the jurisdiction which a court including this Court has from sources other than the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth itself Rather s 13 provides that the Act does not confer on or invest jurisdiction on or in a court in a matter which is not of a kind mentioned in ss 76ii or iii of the Constitution  In ascertaining the scope of jurisdiction which the Federal Court may exercise s 13 thus provides some guidance It contemplates that matters of a kind mentioned in ss 76ii and iii of the Constitution can be within the jurisdiction of the Court Section 76iii of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction is a clear source of power to enact the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth itself and define maritime claims as well as associated matters of Admiralty and marine jurisdiction in ss 4 and 12  And s 76ii provides that the judicial power of the Commonwealth is invoked in any matter arising under any laws made by the Parliament The purpose of s 13 is to limit in the construction of the Act the conferral of jurisdiction by the Act to matters within the power of the Parliament and the judicial power of the Commonwealth It is not to limit the other powers of a court on or in which the Act confers or invests jurisdiction Clearly enough s 86 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth is a law made by the Parliament which confers jurisdiction on this Court independently of the jurisdiction conferred on it by the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth It is quite inappropriate to read provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court by making implications or imposing limitations which are not found in the express words Owners of Shin Kobe Maru v Empire Shipping Co Inc 1994 HCA 54  1994 181 CLR 404 at 421 see too Mansfield v Director of Public Prosecutions for Western Australia 2006 HCA 38 at 7  10 per Gleeson CJ Gummow Kirby Hayne and Crennan JJ Once the jurisdiction of this Court has been invoked the Court should exercise it  Re Wakim Ex parte McNally 1999 HCA 27  1999 198 CLR 511 at 588 149  even if it be to protect itself and its processes against their abuse cf Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority 2006 HCA 27 315 per Gleeson CJ Gummow Hayne and Crennan JJ see too Elbe Shipping SA v The Ship Global Peace 2006 FCA 954 at 138 per Allsop J see too at 6276 Comandate Marine also argued that a limitation was imposed on courts exercising jurisdiction conferred by the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth by s 31 But s 311 provides that the liability on a judgment of a relevant person defined by s 31 as a person who would be liable were the proceedings in personam brought against that person who has entered an appearance in a proceeding on a maritime claim commenced as an action in rem against a ship or property is not limited to the value of the ship or other property The section confirms the amplitude of the jurisdiction rather than restricts it Next Comandate Marine argued that a relevant person who appears in proceedings commenced by a writ in rem cannot be sued in proceedings in personam in this Court in respect of matters outside the relief claimed in the writ in rem on a cause of action other than a maritime claim within the meaning of s 4 of the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth or on associated matters of admiralty and marine jurisdiction within the meaning of s 12 of that Act Here part of the matter within the meaning of ss 76ii and iii of the Constitution  is the controversy between the parties under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth which Pan has pleaded The judicial power of the Commonwealth is exercised in resolving such matters Here the controversy involves claims under two Acts of the Parliament each of which specifically and independently one of the other confers jurisdiction on this Court Accordingly I am of opinion that this Court does have jurisdiction to hear and determine such an in personam proceeding as this That is not to say however that the ship or property the subject of the writ in rem will be available necessarily to answer any judgment for any in personam claim against a relevant person such as one under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth which is neither a maritime claim or an associated matter within the meaning of ss 4 or 12  I am of opinion that the Admiralty Act 1988 Cth cannot be construed as in any way limiting the jurisdiction of this Court to hear and determine any matter within its jurisdiction Rather appositely to the present proceedings there may be a question at the trial as to the availability of the bank guarantee which Comandate Marine provided as security in lieu of the ship Comandate to satisfy a claim made by Pan which is not within ss 4 or 12 of the Act Pans claim in personam for relief under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth is not invalid and its proceedings in personam are not invalidated by that claim s 51 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 Cth The Court at the final hearing can address any injustice which might arise if Comandate Marine wishes then to agitate such matters including whether the security provided should be available to satisfy any claim under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth The Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth provides Pan with remedies different to any remedy that could be awarded in pursuance of its contract claims Indeed one of the remedies it seeks is the avoidance of the contract not pursuant to contractual principles but by force of an order under s 87 of the Act Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Limited 2004 HCA 3  2004 216 CLR 388 at 409 52  And the High Court has emphasized that the remedies under the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth are designed to give effect in cases of contravention of s 52  to the prescribed standards of conduct which are embodied in that section where activities occur in trade or commerce Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited 2000 HCA 12  2000 202 CLR 45 at 83 97  Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree 2005 HCA 69  2005 80 ALJR 183 International trade including the entry into charter parties for vessels is quintessentially within the trade and commerce clause of the Constitution s 51i And par 15 of the amended statement of claim pleads specifically that the relevant conduct occurred in Australia because the communications and representations were received by Mr Colaco in Australia see Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Limited

facie  it appears that the respondent has infringed the applicants patent In my view there is a serious question to be tried  Irreparable harm   In both written and oral submissions the applicant has asserted    1 The applicant commercially exploits the patent by producing an insulation product known as Glareshield According to the affidavit of Mr Nicholas Martinovich the National Sales Manager for the applicant filed 28 June 2006 Glareshield is by far the single biggest selling product of the applicant accounting for approximately 85 per cent of the total insulation product sales of the applicant in Australia 2 Already two of its shed customers Action Garages and another entity identified as Coastal Garages are no longer purchasing Glareshield from the applicants New South Wales distributor however these customers continue in business The applicant believes that at least one of these former customers is purchasing Super Bubble from the respondent 3 The applicants New South Wales licensee has suffered losses in excess of 30 000 for the period March to May 2006 which losses are also affecting the business of the applicant 4 The threat to the loss of sales of Glareshield may result in a diminished ability of the applicant to undertake research and development which would place the ongoing viability of the applicant at risk    From the evidence presented this morning it is likely that damages in this case would be an inadequate remedy should the applicant be successful at trial Alleged poaching of customers by the respondent the importance of the Glareshield product to the applicants business and goodwill associated with the product indicate that irreparable harm is a possible consequence of continuation of the respondents activities I also note the submission of the applicant that the respondent appears to have a paidup capital of 10 rendering a damages award potentially worthless  Balance of convenience   Through the affidavit of Mr Scott Gibson the managing director of the applicant filed 28 June 2006 the applicant has offered an undertaking as to damages in the event of success in obtaining interlocutory relief In view of this undertaking in addition to the harm the applicant says that it is experiencing from the respondents conduct and the fact that there is a serious question to be tried the relief sought by the applicant is appropriate  COSTS   The applicant has made a number of submissions to me in relation to costs in this matter In essence the applicant seeks costs on an indemnity basis or alternatively an order under Federal Court Rules O 62 r 3 that costs be taxed and paid forthwith  Indemnity costs   In oral and written submissions Mr Logan for the applicant relied on two points in support of an order for indemnity costs First the applicant relied on what it describes as a pattern of deliberate and calculated conduct in cynical and flagrant disregard of the applicants intellectual property rights which has resulted in the need to appear before me today Counsel cited Masha Nominees v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd 2006 VSC 56 as authority that prelitigation conduct may be considered in the context of determining whether the circumstances as a whole warrant the making of an indemnity costs order Second citing Colgate Palmolive Co v Cussons Pty Ltd 1993 46 FCR 225 the applicant states that where an applicant has commenced a proceeding in circumstances where properly advised it should have known that there was no chance of success then that is a circumstance which would justify an indemnity costs order Counsel for the applicant submits that by analogy to a respondent  such order would be justified where there is no defence asserted but the respondent continues its conduct so as to put the applicant in a position where it can do nothing other than commence proceedings and incur substantial expense in mounting an interlocutory relief application where in effect properly advised it ought always to have known that there was no answer to the application Whilst I note the applicants submissions in relation to indemnity costs I am not persuaded at this stage that this is a case in which there are special or unusual features such as to justify the Court departing from the ordinary practice Whilst I accept that there is a serious question to be tried and that an interlocutory injunction should be granted I am not of the view that in the absence of submissions from the respondent I can be certain that the respondent has no defence and is acting in such a way as having its only purpose ensuring the applicant incurs substantial expense I note that the respondent currently has different legal representatives to those which were retained when the applicant first commenced raising concerns with the respondent over the patent and apparently the parties have been engaged in discussions over the past few weeks I am unaware of how long its current legal representatives have been acting on the respondents behalf In these circumstances I am not of the view that an order for costs on an indemnity basis would be just and appropriate  Order 62 rule 3   In oral submissions Mr Logan pressed that a costs order of some nature ought to be made today and that this is a case where an order allowing the applicant to tax its costs forthwith is warranted The applicant submits that due to the conduct of the respondent significant additional costs in preparation for the interlocutory hearing have been incurred Federal Court Rules O 62 r 3 provides   An order for costs of an interlocutory proceeding shall not unless the Court otherwise orders entitle a party to have a bill of costs taxed until the principal proceedings in which the interlocutory order is made is concluded or further order   I am not persuaded that this is an appropriate circumstance in which to order that costs be taxed and paid forthwith I note the observations of Emmett J in Brasington v Overton Investments Pty Ltd 2001 FCA 571 where his Honour considered the rationale for the rule    The rationale for such a provision appears to me to be that since an interlocutory proceeding does not resolve the final issue between the parties it would in ordinary circumstances be inappropriate that an unsuccessful party in an interlocutory proceeding be required to pay costs immediately as that party might ultimately be entitled to an order for costs in the substantive proceeding The general principle appears to be that costs ought to be resolved when the proceeding has been concluded and the rights of the parties have been finally determined    The rule of course anticipates that there will be some circumstances where the general principle should be diverted from As discussed earlier in this judgment I am not persuaded that this is a case where the applicant has incurred significant additional costs by reason of the respondents conduct in respect of this litigation While the respondent has failed to appear today and has not entered a notice of appearance I am not persuaded that the applicant would have incurred less costs if the respondent had appeared before me today While the applicant has incurred considerable costs in this matter in relation to its intellectual property rights the situation is not one of special circumstances such as to divert from the general principles The future course of this litigation may shed more light on the conduct of the respondent such as to justify special orders as to costs however in my view having not had the benefit of submissions from the respondent today the appropriate order is that the issue of costs be reserved  CONCLUSION   It is unfortunate that the respondent has not appeared today However in view of the evidence presented by the applicant I am persuaded that it would be appropriate to grant the applicant the interlocutory relief it seeks In oral submissions the applicant pressed for permanent relief to be granted by the Court today However I am not persuaded on the facts that it would be an appropriate order Notwithstanding the failure of the respondent to appear today I note that the matter has been treated by all parties and indeed conducted by the applicant in the lead up to the hearing this morning as an application for interlocutory relief On that basis it is reasonable to presume that the respondent was expecting to have its day in court when the application for permanent relief was heard Accordingly I make orders as follows   1 Upon the undertaking of the applicant    a to submit to such order if any as the Court may consider to be just for the payment of compensation in an amount to be assessed by the Court or as it may direct to the respondent should it be found that it has

respondent has failed to appear today and has not entered a notice of appearance I am not persuaded that the applicant would have incurred less costs if the respondent had appeared before me today While the applicant has incurred considerable costs in this matter in relation to its intellectual property rights the situation is not one of special circumstances such as to divert from the general principles The future course of this litigation may shed more light on the conduct of the respondent such as to justify special orders as to costs however in my view having not had the benefit of submissions from the respondent today the appropriate order is that the issue of costs be reserved  CONCLUSION   It is unfortunate that the respondent has not appeared today However in view of the evidence presented by the applicant I am persuaded that it would be appropriate to grant the applicant the interlocutory relief it seeks In oral submissions the applicant pressed for permanent relief to be granted by the Court today However I am not persuaded on the facts that it would be an appropriate order Notwithstanding the failure of the respondent to appear today I note that the matter has been treated by all parties and indeed conducted by the applicant in the lead up to the hearing this morning as an application for interlocutory relief On that basis it is reasonable to presume that the respondent was expecting to have its day in court when the application for permanent relief was heard Accordingly I make orders as follows   1 Upon the undertaking of the applicant    a to submit

06_1117.xml,c5,cited,Masha Nominees v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd [2006] VSC 56,In this case there is evidence that the respondent has sold or attempted to sell Super Bubble to third parties 24 Prima facie  it appears that the respondent has infringed the applicants patent In my view there is a serious question to be tried  Irreparable harm   In both written and oral submissions the applicant has asserted    1 The applicant commercially exploits the patent by producing an insulation product known as Glareshield According to the affidavit of Mr Nicholas Martinovich the National Sales Manager for the applicant filed 28 June 2006 Glareshield is by far the single biggest selling product of the applicant accounting for approximately 85 per cent of the total insulation product sales of the applicant in Australia 2 Already two of its shed customers Action Garages and another entity identified as Coastal Garages are no longer purchasing Glareshield from the applicants New South Wales distributor however these customers continue in business The applicant believes that at least one of these former customers is purchasing Super Bubble from the respondent 3 The applicants New South Wales licensee has suffered losses in excess of 30 000 for the period March to May 2006 which losses are also affecting the business of the applicant 4 The threat to the loss of sales of Glareshield may result in a diminished ability of the applicant to undertake research and development which would place the ongoing viability of the applicant at risk    From the evidence presented this morning it is likely that damages in this case would be an inadequate remedy should the applicant be successful at trial Alleged poaching of customers by the respondent the importance of the Glareshield product to the applicants business and goodwill associated with the product indicate that irreparable harm is a possible consequence of continuation of the respondents activities I also note the submission of the applicant that the respondent appears to have a paidup capital of 10 rendering a damages award potentially worthless  Balance of convenience   Through the affidavit of Mr Scott Gibson the managing director of the applicant filed 28 June 2006 the applicant has offered an undertaking as to damages in the event of success in obtaining interlocutory relief In view of this undertaking in addition to the harm the applicant says that it is experiencing from the respondents conduct and the fact that there is a serious question to be tried the relief sought by the applicant is appropriate  COSTS   The applicant has made a number of submissions to me in relation to costs in this matter In essence the applicant seeks costs on an indemnity basis or alternatively an order under Federal Court Rules O 62 r 3 that costs be taxed and paid forthwith  Indemnity costs   In oral and written submissions Mr Logan for the applicant relied on two points in support of an order for indemnity costs First the applicant relied on what it describes as a pattern of deliberate and calculated conduct in cynical and flagrant disregard of the applicants intellectual property rights which has resulted in the need to appear before me today Counsel cited Masha Nominees v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd 2006 VSC 56 as authority that prelitigation conduct may be considered in the context of determining whether the circumstances as a whole warrant the making of an indemnity costs order Second citing Colgate Palmolive Co v Cussons Pty Ltd 1993 46 FCR 225 the applicant states that where an applicant has commenced a proceeding in circumstances where properly advised it should have known that there was no chance of success then that is a circumstance which would justify an indemnity costs order Counsel for the applicant submits that by analogy to a respondent  such order would be justified where there is no defence asserted but the respondent continues its conduct so as to put the applicant in a position where it can do nothing other than commence proceedings and incur substantial expense in mounting an interlocutory relief application where in effect properly advised it ought always to have known that there was no answer to the application Whilst I note the applicants submissions in relation to indemnity costs I am not persuaded at this stage that this is a case in which there are special or unusual features such as to justify the Court departing from the ordinary practice Whilst I accept that there is a serious question to be tried and that an interlocutory injunction should be granted I am not of the view that in the absence of submissions from the respondent I can be certain that the respondent has no defence and is acting in such a way as having its only purpose ensuring the applicant incurs substantial expense I note that the respondent currently has different legal representatives to those which were retained when the applicant first commenced raising concerns with the respondent over the patent and apparently the parties have been engaged in discussions over the past few weeks I am unaware of how long its current legal representatives have been acting on the respondents behalf In these circumstances I am not of the view that an order for costs on an indemnity basis would be just and appropriate  Order 62 rule 3   In oral submissions Mr Logan pressed that a costs order of some nature ought to be made today and that this is a case where an order allowing the applicant to tax its costs forthwith is warranted The applicant submits that due to the conduct of the respondent significant additional costs in preparation for the interlocutory hearing have been incurred Federal Court Rules O 62 r 3 provides   An order for costs of an interlocutory proceeding shall not unless the Court otherwise orders entitle a party to have a bill of costs taxed until the principal proceedings in which the interlocutory order is made is concluded or further order   I am not persuaded that this is an appropriate circumstance in which to order that costs be taxed and paid forthwith I note the observations of Emmett J in Brasington v Overton Investments Pty Ltd 2001 FCA 571 where his Honour considered the rationale for the rule    The rationale for such a provision appears to me to be that since an interlocutory proceeding does not resolve the final issue between the parties it would in ordinary circumstances be inappropriate that an unsuccessful party in an interlocutory proceeding be required to pay costs immediately as that party might ultimately be entitled to an order for costs in the substantive proceeding The general principle appears to be that costs ought to be resolved when the proceeding has been concluded and the rights of the parties have been finally determined    The rule of course anticipates that there will be some circumstances where the general principle should be diverted from As discussed earlier in this judgment I am not persuaded that this is a case where the applicant has incurred significant additional costs by reason of the respondents conduct in respect of this litigation While the respondent has failed to appear today and has not entered a notice of appearance I am not persuaded that the applicant would have incurred less costs if the respondent had appeared before me today

and McHugh J concluded at 560   Where a donor with the intention of making a gift delivers to the donee an instrument of transfer in registrable form with the certificate of title so as to enable him to obtain registration an equity arises not from the transfer itself but from the execution and delivery of the transfer and the delivery of the certificate of title in such circumstances as will enable the donee to procure the vesting of the legal title in himself      The question is then whether Mrs Patton did all that it was necessary for her to do in order to effect a transferSimilarly Deane J articulated the relevant test in the following terms at 582   It is whether the donor has done all that is necessary to place the vesting of the legal title within the control of the donee and beyond the recall or intervention of the donor  Once that stage is reached and the gift is complete and effective in equity the equitable interest in the land vests in the donee and that being so the donor is bound in conscience to hold the property as trustee for the donee pending the vesting of the legal title emphasis addedTogether Mason CJ McHugh and Deane JJ constituted the majorityThe principles preferred by the High Court in Corin v Patton were applied by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Costin v Costin 1997 7 BPR 15167 In that case Eric Costin made arrangements to transfer an interest in property to his son Nicholas the respondent He executed a transfer and instructed his solicitors to provide the certificate of title to allow registration However before his solicitors carried out those instructions Eric Costin changed his mind and executed a transfer to his other son Robert the appellant which was then registered The Court of Appeal resolved the dispute between the sons in favour of Robert Brownie AJA with whom Powell JA agreed held at 15170    the intended gift by Eric Costin to the respondent was complete in the sense that the donor had done all that was required to be done by him alone to transfer the legal title If his solicitors had acted as he had directed the legal title would have passed But the donor had not done all that was necessary to render the gift binding upon himself or to arm or equip the donee with the means of securing registration of the transfer or of putting the transfer beyond the donors recall or intervention  As the events that occurred demonstrated the donor effectively allowed the appellant rather than the respondent to become the owner at law of the donors interest in the property   The respondent submitted and I accept that the donor intended to perfect his gift but he failed to achieve that aim before changing his intention  As Corin and other cases show more is needed No doubt too it is true that if the donors solicitors had promptly done what the donor directed them to do the gift would have become complete and effective and it would have become impossible for the donor to recall the gift but this did not happen and the case has to be considered in the light of what did happen rather than what might have happened emphasis addedThe main issue to be resolved in this proceeding is whether the gift to the family trust in 1987 was perfected in accordance with the principles established by the High Court in Corin v Patton  In other words did the bankrupt do all that was necessary to arm the donee with the capacity to register the titles in the name of Optquest Pty Ltd the trustee of the family trustThat question can best be answered by considering the position of the mortgagees of the various properties at the time of the supposed gift There is no evidence whatever that consents to the transfers were obtained from any of the mortgagees The transfers executed in 1987 bore no endorsement by the mortgagees The evidence goes no further than to establish that correspondence passed between Mr Dwyer and one mortgagee the Bendigo Building Society regarding what one might infer concerned the obtaining of such consent That falls well short of establishing that any such consent was actually obtainedWithout the consent of the mortgagees of each of the properties having first been obtained the transfers could not have been registered Accordingly the bankrupt would not have done all that was necessary to place the vesting of the legal title within the control of Optquest Pty Ltd and so beyond his recall or intervention In other words there was nothing to prevent the bankrupt from changing his mind and electing not to proceed with the giftIn any event the bankrupts somewhat cavalier attitude towards prospective lenders is of little consequence in resolving this proceeding The plain fact is that according to the principles laid down in Corin v Patton  whatever may have been the bankrupts intent in 1987 he did not do enough to perfect the gift of the properties to the family trustI accept that the bankrupt set out to establish a family trust and to transfer ownership of the properties to that trust However the evidence shows that mortgage consents were not obtained There were no endorsements by the mortgagees on the transfers as would have been required before the transfers could be registered In addition stamp duty was not paid though this obligation ordinarily rests upon the transferee rather than the transferorThe bankrupt was well aware within a few weeks of executing the transfers that stamp duty had not been paid He took no steps in relation to that matter and made no complaint to the Law Institute regarding Mr Dwyers conduct I infer on the basis of the letter sent to him by Mr Dwyer on 1 March 1988 that he was aware at least by that date that further steps needed to be taken in relation to procuring the mortgagees consents to the transfers Therefore to the extent that it may be relevant the bankrupt cannot claim ignorance of that fact in order to overcome the difficulty that the gift was not perfected

06_1130.xml,c0,discussed,Tapgnuk v Northern Land Council (1996) 5 NTLR 109,Before the Deed of Grant was made the Kamu made representations to the NLC They did so because the NLC is required by s 23 and 24 of the ALRA to determine who are the traditional Aboriginal owners of land that has been the subject of a grant under the ALRA see Tapgnuk v Northern Land Council 1996 5 NTLR 109  Tapgnuk  They said their traditional ownership in the eastern part of the claim area had not been recognised They challenged the Commissioners findings that the Malak Malak were the traditional owners of the land granted and the findings that as a group of people the Kamu no longer existedThe NLCs function under ss 23 and 24 of the ALRA is a significant one It accepts that in performing its function it must comply with the rules of procedural fairness It endeavoured to do so by adopting an adjudicative process described below including hearing evidence and submissions from the Malak Malak and from the KamuThe dispute between the Malak Malak and the Kamu could not be resolved informally The NLC therefore established the Committee to make findings and recommendations in relation to the traditional ownership of the disputed part of the land contained within the Land TrustIn Tapgnuk Angel J expressly declined to declare that the NLC was bound by the findings in the Toohey Report in exercising its function of determining who are the traditional Aboriginal owners of the land in the name of the Land Trust The application by or on behalf of the Malak Malak to have the NLC reject the claimed interest of the Kamu in part of that land was unsuccessful The NLC had to make its own decisions as to who the traditional owners were at a relevant time His Honour at 114115 in reaching that conclusion considered the obligation on the NLC under s 233 to have regard to and to consult with the traditional Aboriginal owners if any of the land as indicating a legislative intention that the NLC should form its own view on that matter Otherwise apart from Schedule 1 land the words if any would be otiose Section 24 empowering the NLC to compile a register of the traditional Aboriginal owners in Angel Js view at 115116 fortified that conclusion by the use of the words in the opinion of the CouncilAt 117 Angel J said   The initial starting point for both the Commissioner and the Land Council must be the definition of traditional Aboriginal owner and all that it incorporates within s 31 of the Act As a consequence the same considerations that a Land Commissioner applies must be applied by the Council Providing the Council forms its opinion in accordance with law it is entitled to form a contrary view to the Land Commissioner Such a contrary view could only be formed in limited circumstances if traditional Aboriginal owners change through succession over time if the Land Commissioner failed to identify all the traditional Aboriginal owners or if the Land Commissioners inquiry was seriously flawed in some material respectI agree with the submission that his Honours use of the word could in that passage should be understood as meaning only that in a practical sense a different factual decision on the composition of the traditional Aboriginal owners will only be made following a report of the Aboriginal Land Commissioner in the rare type of circumstances to which his Honour referredAs its title indicates the claim area concerned part of the area through which the Daly River runs in a roughly northwesterly direction towards the coast The Toohey Report includes two maps one of which identifies the many sites of significance within the area of the land grant The eastern portion of the claim area includes two sites numbered 146 and 47 in respect of which the key person is said to be Kitty Pan Quee Mrs Pan Quee was recognised in the Toohey Report as a surviving Kamu personThe map comprising part of the Committee Report reveals that the contentious sites Jirigij Jugirij Jebenyi Kabamal Kabumal Ngulukmoenet Coppermine Graves Ngalyuwuy and the Mt Hayward area in the vicinity of WaniAlawun are in the central eastern or upper eastern part of the land trust area as is the site Durk KoenThe Toohey Report at 16 recognised that the Malak Malak not only identify themselves and distinguish themselves from other tribunal or linguistic groups but do so to emphasise that they are the traditional Aboriginal owners of the land because they are Malak Malak It also recognised at 20 that the position of the Kamu is crucial to the claim as there was evidence that Kamu country used to run from upstream of the Daly River roughly in the eastern section of the claim area The thesis with which Justice Toohey was presented in evidence was that by 1932 the Kamu dialect was practically extinct that by about that time the Malak Malak a group comprising the integration of the Malak Malak and the Madngele people had taken over responsibility for the former Kamu area and that Mrs Pan Quee had said that she wanted the Malak Malak to look after the former Kamu area but preserving only hunting and foraging rights for herselfThe Committee identified its task as applying the statutory definition of traditional Aboriginal owners to the material presented to it including the evidence of the Aboriginal people themselves to decide whether the Kamu or the Malak Malak are the traditional owners of the disputed country In doing so it said it followed the guidance of Angel J in Tapgnuk at 117 It said it would give proper weight and respect to the findings in the Toohey ReportThe Committee noted at 32 that some 20 years had elapsed since the Toohey Report and that over that time the circumstances of the Aboriginal people concerned have changed significantly It noted at 32 that the core Malak Malak people now are Albert Myoung and his five sisters all of whom reside on the Land trust area and all of whom speak Malak Malak and know a lot about the areaThe Committee noted at 33 that the Kamu the core element being Mrs Pan Quees children and grandchildren have since the Toohey Report sought to be recognised as the traditional Aboriginal owners of the eastern part of the Land Trust land They acknowledge that Mrs Pan Quee told Justice Toohey that she was giving the Kamu land to the Malak Malak but they dispute that they thereby or otherwise ceased to be its traditional Aboriginal owners They do not live on that land but since the Toohey Report have visited and camped there including in rudimentary buildings for lengthy periods The Kamu language is no longer spoken but the Kamu in particular Marjorie Foster one of the five sisters and her children profess a strong sense of identity as Kamu and as Aboriginal people associated with Kamu country in the Daly River region and are likely to pass it on in turn to their childrenOnce it was accepted that the Committee was obliged to address the competing claims of the Malak Malak and the Kamu under the ALRA and was not bound to adopt the conclusions in the Toohey Report in accordance with the decision of Angel J in Tapgnuk  the Committee had to determine among other things whether the Kamu were a local descent group who had common spiritual affiliations to a site or sites in the Land Trust area Its abbreviated expression simply reflects its findings on that matter a matter required to be addressed by the ALRA and its findings that in respect of some sites within the Land Trust area the Malak Malak also had common spiritual affiliations to certain of the same sites I do not consider that its approach to the question posited by the definition of traditional Aboriginal owners in the ALRA was infected by some misplaced preconception about how that task should be carried out The Committee has identified the correct question It has had regard to the evidence And it has reached a conclusion on the issue it was required to address and explained how it came to that conclusionAlthough the Malak Malak did not contend that the Committee could not use its general knowledge and experience and did not contend subject to the first mentioned contention above which I have rejected that as a matter of fact there could never be shared country between Aboriginal groups at the margins of neighbouring country they nevertheless criticised the evidence identified in the Kamu submissions that in fact there was certain shared country between the Malak Malak and the Kamu They did so because the evidence referred to was evidence also before Justice Toohey but had not led to a conclusion in the Toohey Report that the Kamu continued to exist as traditional Aboriginal owners of part of the Land Trust area I do not consider that criticism demonstrates any reviewable error on the part of the Committee There was clearly such evidence before Justice Toohey I do not need to refer to it But the Committee was required to come to its own conclusions and it did so having regard not only to the evidence before Justice Toohey and the conclusions in the Toohey Report but also to the additional evidence which it received and to which it referred That further evidence went to the existence of the Kamu as a local descent group and to that groups common spiritual affiliations with certain sites within the Land Trust areaI do not accept that the Committees report indicates that it failed properly to apply the requirements of the ALRA and somehow strayed into some kind of middle ground to accommodate the interests of each party Nor do I accept that the passages complained of reflect that the Committee assumed that in the case of the competing claimants which it was considering the solution should be some form of sharing For the reasons I have given upon my reading of the Committees report it simply recognised the questions it had to address and having addressed them it concluded in fact that in respect of certain sites the responsibility and common spiritual associations of the Malak Malak and of the Kamu overlapped

470 at 475478The parties were agreed that the fact that because the definitions of both traditional Aboriginal owners and of Aboriginal tradition are expressed in the present tense the identity of traditional owners may evolve somewhat over time and that the strength of spiritual affiliations to sites and spiritual responsibility for sites may vary in strength from time to time see eg per Brennan J in The Queen v Toohey Ex parte Meneling Station Proprietary Limited 1982 HCA 69  1983 158 CLR 327  Meneling Station  at 359 and Northern Land Council v Olney 1992 34 FCR 470 at 485 Senior counsel for the Malak Malak pointed out without demur that the functions of a Land Council are the same whether the land the subject of a land grant under the ALRA followed a recommendation of the Land Rights Commissioner or was Schedule 1 land The focus on the present traditional Aboriginal owners is also recognised in ss 195 231ei 233 422a 423 and 464a of the ALRA A Land Council is empowered by s 24a to compile and maintain a register of the names of persons who in the opinion of the Land Council are the traditional Aboriginal owners of the Aboriginal land in the area of the Land CouncilThe distribution between those two categories was recognised by Brennan J in Meneling Station at 358 and 360 by Wilson and Brennan JJ in Re Toohey Ex parte Stanton 1982 44 ALR 94  Stanton  at 100 and 104 respectively and by the Full Court in Northern Land Council v Olney at 479 It emerges clearly enough from provisions of the ALRA see eg ss 231b c and e and s 71 As the contentions of the Malak Malak point out the Committee report does not explicitly refer to that broader categoryThe issue has not been the subject of direct judicial determination although Justice Toohey as the Aboriginal Land Commissioner in his Report in the Finniss River Land Claim in 1981 appears to have accepted at 100 218 220 225 and 234 that there may be more than one group of traditional Aboriginal owners of a particular site or area of country I do not consider the observations of Brennan J in Meneling Station at 356360 support the contention of the Malak Malak That case relevantly concerned s 503 of the ALRA If anything in my view his Honours remarks at 358 suggest that there may be more than one group of traditional Aboriginal owners His Honour said of the Aboriginal Land Commissioners function under s 501 that it requires him    to evaluate the spiritual affiliations and spiritual responsibility of any local descent group of Aboriginals who may claim to be traditional owners of the land in question or who may appear to have a traditional claim to that land my emphasis Moreover Meneling Station concerned the Finniss River Land Claim Report so that such an approach by the Aboriginal Land Commissioner may have attracted some judicial comment if it were not consistent with the ALRA It also appears that the Full Court in Northern Land Council v Olney at 490 contemplated the possibility of there being more than one local descent group each having common spiritual affiliations to a siteThat construction is consistent with a number of reports of Aboriginal Land Commissioners under the ALRA They are noted in Neate  Aboriginal Land Rights Law in the Northern Territory Alternative Publishing Cooperative Ltd Sydney 1989 at Ch 3 fn 298 Since 1989 a number of similar reports have been made including Justice Gray in the Jawoyn Gimbat Area Land Claim Report 1995 especially at 428 and Justice Olney in the WakayaAlawarre Land Claim Report 1990 especially at 58 I note as senior counsel for the Malak Malak pointed out both those reports concerned claimant groups who were not competing with each other Moreover that construction in my view is consistent with giving the ALRA a broad construction so as to give effect to the beneficial purpose for which it was intended see eg R v Kearney Ex parte Jurlama 1984 HCA 14  1984 158 CLR 426 at 433 and Northern Land Council v Olney at 479 It is unlikely that the ALRA was intended either to exclude altogether from the traditional ownership both local descent groups if for example there were found to be two local descent groups each with the specified characteristics in relation to a particular site or alternatively to force a decision between competing local descent groups on some unspecified basis when reach was found to have the specified characteristics in relation to a particular siteOnce it is accepted that as a matter of law there may be two groups of persons who are each traditional Aboriginal owners of particular sites or country the fact that there are competing groups making mutually exclusive claims is simply a matter the decisionmaker must take into account It doe not follow that the decisionmaker having taken all relevant material into account will err in a reviewable way if both groups are found to be traditional Aboriginal owners As the Full Court in Northern Land Council v Olney said at 487    the question whether or not a group of claimants can establish its status as traditional Aboriginal owners of the land is ultimately a question of applying the statute to the particular facts as foundThe Malak Malak point out that the statutory definition of traditional Aboriginal owners refers to common spiritual affiliations to a site on the relevant country That requirement of commonality is one which the members of a local descent group must enjoy as among themselves It is not a requirement that in the case of there being more than one local descent group all the members of each local descent group must collectively enjoy commonality of spiritual affiliations It is plain that subpar a of the definition prescribes a particular characteristic for a local descent groupAs I have indicated the definition of traditional Aboriginal owners is satisfied only if the group of Aboriginals who comprise a local descent group have common spiritual affiliations to a site on the land That requirement was explained by the Full Court in Northern Land Council v Olney at 485488 It is clearly a requirement or characteristic which a local descent group must satisfy before it comes within the definition Where a local descent group has that characteristic in relation to a site on the land and also satisfies the other elements of the definition it will qualify as traditional Aboriginal owners in relation to that land If there are two local descent groups who so qualify by the application of the statute they each enjoy that status in relation to that land There is no requirement in the definition that the members of each such group must then be found collectively to have common spiritual affiliations with that land It therefore is not to the point in my view at least in relation to this contention that there are examples where the Malak Malak and the Kamu gave different evidence as to the nature of their respective common spiritual affiliations with particular sites such as Jebenyi or NgulukmoenetKabamal or the area of Mt Hayward called Wani Alawun by the Malak Malak and Ngalyuwuy by the KamuThose observations indicate why I also do not accept the further contention of the Malak Malak that the Committee erred in proceeding on the basis that there can be more than one landowning group in relation to a particular area of land in circumstances where the members of both groups do not hold spiritual affiliations in common with each otherIt is also convenient at this point to address a subsidiary contention of the Malak Malak that the Committee erred by not addressing the existence or otherwise of the common spiritual affiliations of the Kamu local descent group in the manner required The pithy contention was that the Committee made findings about the spiritual affiliations of each group rather than about those of their membersThe approach to that aspect of fact finding was described by the Full Court in Northern Land Council v Olney at 487488 as follows   The task of the Commissioner is first to ascertain the relevant group to be investigated and then to determine whether the members of that group have the requisite common spiritual affiliation such that the group is as a result under a primary spiritual responsibility for the site and the land A group necessarily comprises persons Clearly it is not necessary to call each member of the group to give evidence to establish that they have the appropriate spiritual affiliation It will be sufficient if the evidence establishes on the balance of probabilities that the Aboriginals who comprise the group have that affiliationIn my view the Committee is not shown to have departed from the proper decisionmaking process or to have misunderstood its task In accordance with what the Full Court then went on to indicate at 488 the Committee recognised that the common spiritual affiliations have to be possessed by the individuals who comprise the group I do not read 100 of the Committee Report as indicating any departure from that process Its decision was based upon the evidence of individual members of the Kamu given at a number of sites It clearly recognised that the Kamu comprise a number of individuals who are descendants of Mrs Pan Quee In my view its focus when making its findings on this aspect was properly upon the Aboriginals who comprise the Kamu local descent group which it found to existThe next two submissions of the Malak Malak can conveniently be dealt with together They contended that the Committee erred in holding that both the Malak Malak and the Kamu hold joint primary spiritual responsibility for the shared sites And they contended that it erred in finding that the shared sites identify a shared area or zone between the country of the Kamu and the country of the Malak Malak which is an area to which both groups have shared responsibilities and interests

06_1130.xml,c9,discussed,Re Toohey; Ex parte Stanton (1982) 44 ALR 94,The distribution between those two categories was recognised by Brennan J in Meneling Station at 358 and 360 by Wilson and Brennan JJ in Re Toohey Ex parte Stanton 1982 44 ALR 94  Stanton  at 100 and 104 respectively and by the Full Court in Northern Land Council v Olney at 479 It emerges clearly enough from provisions of the ALRA see eg ss 231b c and e and s 71 As the contentions of the Malak Malak point out the Committee report does not explicitly refer to that broader categoryOn the other hand Wilson J with whom Gibbs CJ and Mason J agreed in Stanton at 9899 when addressing the then appellants complaint that their respective claims were not separately addressed on their merits said   It is implicit in Mr Castans submission that the Act contemplates that there may be more than one local descent group of Aboriginals who satisfy the description of traditional Aboriginal owners in respect of the same area of land Such a construction of the Act would in my opinion be somewhat surprising having regard to the definition of such traditional ownership which requires the group inter alia  to have common spiritual affiliations to a site on the land being affiliations that place the group under a primary spiritual responsibility for that site and for the land It is difficult to contemplate two opposing groups each of whom are placed at the same time under a primary spiritual responsibility for the same site and the same land Certainly the claimants in this case each claimed traditional ownership to the exclusion of the other In fact the claims were not only competing but mutually exclusive   The primary submission was rejected so that those observations are not binding It does not appear that the particular issue was argued in that caseIn my judgment there is nothing in the ALRA which indicates that in appropriate factual circumstances there may not be more than one local descent group which can comprise the traditional Aboriginal owners of certain land Indeed if it be accepted that there is not or not always a sharp line defining the boundaries of country between neighbouring Aboriginal groups it would seem to follow that there is in the overlap country the prospect of each of those groups having common spiritual affiliations with that country or sites within it and having a primary spiritual responsibility for those sitesI do not think that Stanton  upon which the Malak Malak rely necessarily supports the contention I have referred above to the relevant passage from the judgment of Wilson J with whom Gibbs CJ and Mason J agreed Reliance was also placed on the observations of Brennan J at 104 where his Honour said   Thirdly it is submitted that the Commissioner ought to have ascertained whether the Maranunggu people on the one hand and the Kungarakany and Warai peoples on the other were all traditional Aboriginal owners of area 1 and part of area 2 Clearly enough the facts upon which the two groups respectively relied were inconsistent with both groups being the traditional Aboriginal owners The Commissioner noted that each of the two groups was asserting to the exclusion of the other traditional ownership of the land  He found in favour of the Maranunggu claim The Commissioner explicitly rejected the Kungarakany claim in respect of area 1 para 192 and area 2 para 207 There is no substance in this groundIt is apparent his Honour concluded that the relevant finding of the Aboriginal Land Commissioner that one of the competing groups was the traditional Aboriginal owners of the particular country in dispute was not infected with reviewable error I do not think it excludes the possibility of there being two groups of traditional Aboriginal owners or that in all circumstances where there are competing groups making exclusive claims there cannot as a matter of law be found to be two groups of traditional Aboriginal ownersThe so called exclusive claims of the Malak Malak and the Kamu in relation to particular sites in the Land Trust area must be seen in context Although they were competing claims the findings in the Toohey Report indicate that the basis of the Malak Malak claim to ownership of certain sites was passed on by Mrs Pan Quee on behalf of the Kamu This is not a case where it had been found that the Kamu at no point in time had ownership of any of the disputed areasThe NLC was required to fulfil its role under the ALRA and established the Committee for the better performance of that function The Committee concluded differently from the Toohey Report that the Kamu continued to exist as a local descent group It was then required to determine whether the Malak Malak or the Kamu or both satisfied the characteristics in the definition of traditional Aboriginal owners There is nothing which as a matter of law obliged the Committee then to ignore its findings which were positive in respect of the shared sites in the case of both the Malak Malak and the Kamu or to find one or other group had a greater primary spiritual responsibility than the other or in some other way to conclude that despite both groups satisfying the definition in respect of particular sites one or other or neither of them should be so recognised The consequences of their respective recognition as traditional Aboriginal owners in respect of particular sites is then simply governed by other provisions of the ALRAI do not accept that by recognising two groups of traditional Aboriginal owners of particular sites the determination of rights or their implementation would be frustrated The NLC has certain consultation obligations with traditional Aboriginal owners and with other Aboriginal persons in certain circumstances The fact that the consent of the traditional Aboriginal owners is also required in respect of some proposed decisions eg under ss 195a and 46 6 will not be impeded although practically it may be more difficult In respect of any groups of traditional Aboriginal owners s 77A provides how the consent may be taken to have been given in the case of intragroup disputes But if as a fact as here found there are in respect of a particular site two groups of traditional Aboriginal owners then the consent of each group will need to be obtained where such consent is required by the Act That is in my view consistent with the beneficial purposes of the Act as it gives each of the groups of traditional Aboriginal owners the ownership or control of decisionmaking through the processes the ALRA contemplates
06_1130.xml,c10,referred_to,Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teoh [1995] HCA 20 ; (1995) 183 CLR 273,The definition of traditional Aboriginal owners accommodates rather than excludes such circumstances If it were intended that in respect of a particular site there would be only one group of traditional Aboriginal owners it would have been expressed to refer to the local descent group rather than a local descent group In my view the use of the indefinite article is intended to allow for more than one such group The use of the definite article in subpara of the definition before the word group is then simply a reference back to the particular local descent group or groups found to exist and require that that particular group or groups have the characteristics specified In addition I consider that the use of the indefinite article before the words primary spiritual responsibility also recognise that there may be more than one local descent group otherwise that part of the definition would also refer to the primary responsibility so as to exclude other local descent groups in respect of a particular site See eg per Mason CJ and Deane J in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teoh 1995 HCA 20  1995 183 CLR 273 at 289To the extent that it is necessary reliance for such a construction may be derived from s 23b of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 Cth which provides for the singular to include the plural Neither text of the definition of traditional Aboriginal owners nor its context in the ALRA indicates that a contrary intention to that construction emerges

06_1133.xml,c0,followed,CDJ v VAJ [1998] HCA 76 ; (1988) 197 CLR 172,The power to receive evidence on appeal is given to the Court by s 27 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 Cth which provides that the court has power  in its discretion to receive further evidence  An identically worded provision in the Family Law Act 1975 was considered by the High Court in CDJ v VAJ 1998 HCA 76  1988 197 CLR 172 McHugh Gummow and Callinan JJ referred to the established common law conditions under which new evidence might be admitted in an appeal by way of rehearing as articulated in Wollongong Corporation v Cowan 1955 HCA 16  1955 93 CLR 435 namely that it was necessary both that the evidence sought to be adduced on appeal could not with reasonable diligence have been obtained for use at the trial and that if the evidence had been available at the trial it was reasonably clear that an opposite result would have been produced 93 CLR at 444 In CDJ  their Honours held that these principles were inapplicable to a situation in which the discretion to admit further evidence did not arise under the common law but was given by statute 197 CLR at 97 They held that the exercise of the discretion under a provision equivalent to s 27 of the Federal Court Act was essentially a matter of statutory construction and should not be approached as though the common law principles conclusively indicate the proper construction of the statutory provision at 102 In the exercise of the statutory power their Honours held the critical factor was the subject matter of the proceedings with which the appeal was concerned because the purpose of the power to admit further evidence is to ensure that the proceedings do not miscarry at 104 They held that under the statutory power the court hearing the appeal weighs factors although it may of course develop guidelines for weighing those factors and exercising the discretion at 104 A little later in their judgment their Honours said that the common law rules as to the admission of fresh evidence cannot exhaustively define the scope of the discretion under the statutory provision at 108 emphasis addedMcHugh Gummow and Callinan JJ then proceeded to advert to a number of considerations any one of which may in an appropriate case influence the exercise of the judicial discretion to admit further evidence First they pointed out that the principal purpose of the statutory provision was to give the court a discretionary power to admit evidence which would demonstrate that the order under appeal was erroneous This was a power which facilitated the avoidance of errors which could not otherwise be remedied by the application of conventional appellate procedures Alternatively and in practice in a subsidiary way the purpose was to give the court discretion to admit further evidence to buttress the findings already made at 109 Secondly their Honours referred to the principle that a provision conferring judicial power on a court should be construed liberally and without the making of implications or the imposition of limitations not found in the words used by the legislature at 110 Thirdly it was relevant that the appellate court was hearing an appeal against an order made in the exercise of original jurisdiction It was unlikely that Parliament should have intended that the statutory provision equivalent to s 27 should be construed in a way that would have the practical effect of obliterating the distinction between original and appellate jurisdiction Fourthly their Honours stressed that the availability of further evidence should not be treated as the equivalent of a ground of appeal proof of which prima facie entitled the appellant to a new trial Their Honours continued   Ordinarily where it is alleged that the admission of new evidence requires a new trial justice will not be served unless the Full court is satisfied that the further evidence would have produced a different result if it had been available at the trial Without that condition being satisfied it could seldom if ever be in the interests of justice to deprive the respondent of the benefit of the orders made by the trial judge and put that person to the expense inconvenience and worry of a new trial  Fifthly their Honours doubted the value of a usefulness test and rejected the proposition that an appellate court might admit further evidence merely because it was useful Sixthly the appellate court would readily admit further evidence which was not in dispute and which the court was able to evaluate and to take into account without the necessity for a rehearing They noted that evidence of this kind was particularly likely to be admitted where it related to events occurring after the trial In such a case the likely effect of the further evidence on the appellate courts view of the evidence before the trial judge was the important consideration They continued  Where there is no need for a new trial or extensive taking of evidence other discretionary factors such as the availability of the evidence at the trial and the need for finality of litigation are likely to be more relevant in the exercise of the discretion than the effect that the evidence would have had at the trial  Seventhly their Honours said that the power to admit further evidence must be exercised judicially adding a comment which related specifically to the Family Law Act but which when considered more generally amounted to the proposition that the discretion to admit further evidence should be affirmatively exercised only if that evidence were relevant and admissible according to ordinary principles or by statute and if there were no reason for suspecting the credibility of the evidence at 115 Eighthly on the subject of a partys failure to adduce the evidence before the primary judge their Honours said at 116  Where the evidence has been deliberately withheld the failure to call it will ordinarily weigh heavily in the exercise of the discretion In other cases the failure to call the evidence even if it could have been discovered by the exercise of reasonable diligence may be of little significance No invariable rule concerning the failure to call the evidence can or should be laid down in view of the wide discretion conferred on the court by the sectionThe High Court judgment in CDJ has been considered twice by a Full Court In Cottrell v Wilcox 2002 FCAFC 53  the Full Court held that the judgment in CDJ was applicable to the discretionary power available under s 27 of the Federal Court Act at 20 Referring to that discretion the Full Court said at 21   That discretion is confined only by the requirement that it be exercised judicially and consistently with the judicial process CDJ v VAJ at 185  It is with respect curious that the Full Court referred to page 185 of the Commonwealth Law Reports in this respect since that page occurs within the reasons for judgment of Gaudron J who dissented Probably however the proposition upon which the Full Court relied is equally harmonious with the broad propositions underlying the judgment of the majority McHugh Gummow and Callinan JJ Importantly for present purposes I do not read Cottrell as precluding me from deriving guidance from the various specific considerations to which their Honours in the majority in CDJ referred as set out aboveThe other Full Court judgment to which reference must be made is NASB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs 2004 FCAFC 24 This was a judgment given on 25 February 2004 which when amended by a corrigendum issued on 12 May 2004 contains the following passage   In order for this Court to receive further evidence generally speaking cf  Cottrell v Wilcox 2002 FCAFC 53  2002 FCA 232 at 18 21 citing CDJ v VAJ 1998 HCA 76  1998 197 CLR 172 at 184186 per Gaudron J 199201 per McHugh Gummow and Callinan JJ and 230238 per Kirby J it will be found that two conditions must be satisfied first the party seeking to adduce the evidence must show that it could not with reasonable diligence have been adduced at the trial and secondly the evidence must be such that very probably the result would have been different see for example Orr v Holmes 1948 HCA 16  1948 76 CLR 632 at 635636 per Latham CJ The second condition has been variously expressed in the cases but the point made in all of them is that it is not enough that the new evidence was relevant and otherwise admissible and may have affected the result Language referring to at the lowest probability and at the highest certainty of a different result has been used cf R v Copestake Ex parte Wilkinson 1927 1 KB 468 at 477 of such importance as very probably to influence the decision and of such weight as if believed would probably have an important influence on the result Orr v Holmes at 636 high degree of probability that the admission of the new evidence would result in a different verdict Florance v Andrew 1985 58

parties almost certain that   an opposite result would have been reached by the primary judge  Although this passage contains an echo of the common law criteria referred to in Wollongong Corporation  and held to be inapplicable under a statutory provision like s 27 in CDJ  the Full Courts reference to CDJ does on my reading of it make it tolerably clear that it considered that CDJ ought to be applied in the exercise of the discretion under s 27 Particularly the Full Court statement that in relation to the second condition it was not enough that the new evidence was relevant and otherwise

06_1138.xml,c0,followed,NAJT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2005) 147 FCR,Mr Jenkins submitted that there was information which had been part of the Tribunals reason for affirming the decision of the delegate which had not been given to the appellant in writing and on which the appellant had not been invited in writing to comment Mr Jenkins supported his application for leave by reference to the judgment of Madgwick J in NAJT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs 2005 FCAFC 134  2005 147 FCR 51 8286 especially at 163166 His Honour with whom Conti J agreed in relevant respects considered the authorities with respect to the granting of leave to argue a new point and set out a list of questions which would be appropriate for the Court to consider in such a setting at 166 Those questions which were expressed as inclusive were   1 Do the new legal arguments have a reasonable prospect of success    5 Is there an acceptable explanation of why they were not raised below  6 How much dislocation to the Court and efficient use of judicial sitting time is really involved  7 What is at stake in the case for the appellant  8 Will the resolution of the issues raised have any importance beyond the case at hand  9 Is there any actual prejudice not viewing the notion of prejudice narrowly to the respondent  10 If so can it be justly and practicably cured  11 If not where in all the circumstances do the interests of justice lie    Mr Reilly who appeared for the first respondent the respondent in the appeal was content to resist Mr Jenkins application for leave broadly within the framework established by Madgwick Js questions In the arguments of counsel before me on the point the main matters agitated were whether the new points now sought to be relied on had reasonable prospects of success whether there was an acceptable explanation for why they had not been raised before the Federal Magistrates Court whether there was actual prejudice to the respondent and whether even if the Tribunal had failed to comply with s 424A as now alleged that omission made any difference to the disposition of the application before itOn the question whether there was an acceptable explanation as to why this point had not been raised before the Federal Magistrate Mr Jenkins submitted that the appellant had represented himself at that stage and that it was apparent that he had no understanding of the nature of an application for judicial review He drew my attention to a passage in the Magistrates reasons which stated   The applicants brief oral submissions were limited to seeking to explain the reasons why he fears persecution in India Mr Reilly drew my attention to the fact that the appellant in NAJT  apparently had given evidence that he could not afford a lawyer in the proceeding before the Magistrate In the present case he correctly pointed out there was no such evidence He submitted that I should not be persuaded that there was an acceptable explanation as to why the point was not raised below Mr Jenkins however relied upon the following paragraph from the judgment of Madgwick J in NAJT at 165  It is no accident that the practice spoken of in VUAX has often occurred in migration matters Especially is this so in relation to cases concerning claims to refugee status In the High Court and in this Court judges have shown as was recognized in Iyer  that they are acutely aware of what may be at stake if the claims made are genuine There is no longer a general system of legal aid for poor applicants as many of them in such cases are who are independently assessed as having reasonably arguable cases Often unrepresented applicants who appear to be decent genuine but impecunious people are reduced to floundering in complete incomprehension of the prevailing system of judicial review or the dangerous partial comprehension of those with a little knowledge of that system Unsurprisingly Full Courts have been slower in such cases to assert the primacy of finality of litigation considerations than in many cases where the risk of very serious personal harm is not involved In saying this I do not lose sight of the fact that to degrees which may vary from place to place and time to time there is a proportion of refugee claims which are simply legally unwarranted and cynical attempts to subvert this countrys immigration system Even the cynic however has a right to lawful treatment In many areas of the law it is sometimes necessary for the sake of the truly deserving to accord concessions also to those ultimately shown to be undeserving  I do not understand Madgwick J to have been purporting to establish any new legal presumption in the passage set out above Whether a particular applicant for a protection visa fits what his Honour appears to regard as a kind of stereotypical template will in my respectful view be a question of fact from case to caseIn the present case the appellants application for judicial review in the Federal Magistrates Court was evidently prepared by someone with an understanding of the jurisdiction which arises under s 39B of the Judiciary Act  The application also contains references to relevant provisions of the Migration Act  and to two Full Court judgments The application in terms seeks writs of certiorari prohibition and mandamus and alleges jurisdictional error in various respects It is signed by the appellant In his visa application the appellant nominated English as the second in point of preference of three languages which he could speak and of two languages which he could speak read and write In the absence of evidence from the appellant on this point I infer that as at May 2005 the appellant had access to and made use of professional advice of sufficient competence to give rise to an awareness of the nature of jurisdictional error and of the remedies available under s 39B of the Judiciary Act  and that he was so aware at least as much as any lay person would be with respect to those technical mattersWhy the appellant did not make use of the advice to which apparently he had access when he appeared before the Federal Magistrate is not the subject of any evidence before me He was represented by counsel in this court and there is likewise no evidence as to why the arrangements which permitted that course to be adopted might not have been put in place at first instanceMy consideration of the other seven items articulated by Madgwick J in NAJT  in relation to this second point follows the same lines as the corresponding consideration of the same items in relation to the appellants first point and I would express the same conclusions in relation to each However because I have come to a different conclusion in relation to the first item prospect of success and because of the importance of that item in the overall consideration of the matter I propose to refuse the appellant leave to rely upon this second point
06_1138.xml,c1,followed,SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2006) 150 FCR,I shall consider first the question whether each of the new points sought to be raised on behalf of the appellant has a reasonable prospect of success The first of these points arises from the following passage in the Tribunals decision   And while claiming in his protection visa application that his mother and sister were attacked with iron rods and wood and were admitted to hospital with severe injuries but on 12 August 2001 his mother died at the hearing the Applicant did not make this claim but rather attributed the death of his mother to his claim that Ravis family destroyed his house and this adversely affected his mother who then passed away  Mr Jenkins submitted that the state of the appellants visa application and specifically the absence therefrom of the explanation later advanced for the death of his mother amounted to information within the meaning of s 424A of the Act  He supported that submission by reference to SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs 2006 FCAFC 2  2006 150 FCR 214 He submitted that in the circumstances the Tribunal was obliged under s 424A to provide the appellants visa application to him in writing and to invite the appellant in writing to comment upon it Mr Jenkins submitted that for these purposes it was not necessary for him to submit that s 424A2 required the explanation ordained by s 424A1b also to be in writing it was clear he submitted that the visa application had not been given to the appellant in writing and that he had not been invited in writing to comment upon itMr Reilly submitted that this new point was of doubtful merit He submitted that assuming that the visa application was information for the purposes of s 424A1  when the Tribunals decision was properly understood it could not be said that the Tribunal considered that that information would be the reason or a part of the reason for affirming the decision under review He submitted that in the passage which I have set out above the Tribunal was doing no more than noting its awareness of two different explanations which had been put forward by the appellant for his mothers death purely as a matter of record as a preliminary to moving forward and determining the case by reference to the explanation put forward at the hearing Mr Reilly emphasised that the Tribunal in relation to the original claim made by the appellant in his visa application said that the appellant did not make this claim which was in his submission a clear statement that the Tribunal was not determining the matter by reference to that claimMr Jenkins point was that it appeared that the Tribunal had taken into account the discrepancy between the two explanations offered by the appellant as to the death of his mother as a matter which had an adverse impact on the appellants credibility He pointed to a number of passages in the Tribunals decision in which the Tribunal found that the appellant was not credible It is clear that the credibility of the appellant was a significant element in the Tribunals decision and if the discrepancy between the two explanations offered by the appellant for the circumstances in which his mother died is to be regarded as an element in the Tribunals general assessment of credibility there would be an argument of apparent force that that discrepancy and the view which the Tribunal took of it constituted part of the reason for affirming the decision under review Mr Reilly however took me to each of the passages in the decision in which the Tribunal had stated in terms that the matter under discussion impacted adversely on its assessment of the credibility of the appellant There were several such passages By contrast as Mr Reilly submitted in the passage dealing with the two explanations offered by the appellant for the death of his mother the Tribunal says nothing in terms about the matter of credibility In his submission the Tribunal should be taken at its word and there should be no ready assumption that that passage was relevant to its consideration of the matter of credibility or became part of its reason for affirming the decision under reviewMr Jenkins rejoined that the reason or each part of the reason which the Tribunal had for affirming the decision under review should be ascertained by a reading of the decision as a whole rather than by the more narrow process of taking only the express words used in immediate conjunction with the passage in question In this respect he relied upon the following words of Weinberg J in SZEEU at 164 165   It would be both artificial and dangerous to determine whether there is a causal link between a piece of information that is seriously adverse to a claimant and a decision rejecting that persons claim by focussing largely upon where in the reasons for decision the information is discussed The actual process by which a decision is reached is of course a complex matter It is not always as neat as the reasons themselves may suggest The reasoning may not proceed in a linear fashion and the Tribunals reasons must of course be read as a whole   The possibility that the similar claims information contributed to the Tribunals rejection of the appellants claim cannot realistically be excluded The appellants credibility was of critical importance to his claim Any information that the Tribunal considered as casting serious doubt upon his credibility whether referred to in the early stages of its reasons or as fortifying its earlier conclusions seems to me likely to have played a part in the decision  Mr Jenkins submitted that the possibility that the Tribunals thinking was influenced by the circumstance that the appellants visa application the original information set up a different explanation for the death of his mother could not be excludedMr Reilly also derived support he submitted from SZEEU He drew my attention to the following words of Allsop J at 216   That said it is necessary to recognise the guidance that one nevertheless receives from aspects of 33 in VAF One always needs to analyse and interpret the reasons of the Tribunal in order to understand the reason for the ultimate reason or conclusion of the lack of satisfaction of the existence of protection obligations Merely because something is contained in the text of the reasons of the Tribunal which involves information does not conclude the question whether it was and in the relevant sense would be a part of the reason for affirming the decision The whole of the written reasons must be analysed and interpreted in their context to assess why it was that the Tribunal acted as it did and so in the relevant sense to assess what would be prior to making the decision the reason or a part of the reason Having thus ascertained the reason or reasons if there be more than one why the Tribunal was not relevantly satisfied any information that was and thus in the relevant sense would be a part of the reasoning process to explain such reason engages the operation of s 424A  without any additional requirement for which Paul and VAF appear to call that the relative importance of the information to the reasoning process be assessed to form a judgment as to whether fairness requires the engagement of s 424A The above tasks of assessment or interpretation of the Tribunals reasons of ascertaining what was any reasoning process and of assessing the relevance of any information thereto may not be straightforward and may lead to conclusions about which minds may differ Mr Reilly particularly stressed that the mere fact that the Tribunal mentioned something in its decision does not mean that it constituted the reason or part of the reason for affirming the decision under reviewIn deciding the question of a reasonable prospect in relation to the first of Mr Jenkins two new points the first matter to consider under s 424A is whether the inclusion in the appellants application for a protection visa of an explanation for the death of his mother which differed from that later stated by him at the hearing before the Tribunal was information within the meaning of the section Mr Reilly did not argue that it was not and I believe that he was welljustified in adopting that course What Mr Jenkins proposed was information in the present case cannot in my view be relevantly distinguished from the kind of thing which the Full Court held to be information in the case of Mr SZBMI in SZEEU The next matter to consider is whether this information was considered by the Tribunal to be the reason or part of the reason for which it affirmed the decision under review In the decided cases in this Court the approach has been taken that the actual reason or part reason for which the Tribunal has affirmed a decision under review as disclosed by an objective analysis of the Tribunals printed decision in the case in question must be treated as the reason which the Tribunal considered to be such for the purposes of s 424A That approach is consistent with the submissions made in the present case and I shall adopt it both at the reasonable prospect and at the level the ultimate merits of the matter should leave to argue the new point be grantedBy s 430 of the Act  the Tribunal was obliged to provide a statement of its reasons Conformably with this requirement the Tribunals published decision contains a section headed Findings and Reasons It is in that section that one finds the passage which I have set out in par 6 above That purely textual circumstance however is not conclusive My task is to isolate what were the integral parts of the reasons for the Tribunals decision VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs 2004 206 ALR 471 33 relied on by Allsop J and apparently also by Weinberg J in SZEEU  150 FCR at 262 216 Nonetheless the placement of the passage in the section of its decision where the Tribunal was ostensibly stating its reasons in compliance with s 430 of the Act does in the context of the whole terms of the decision in the present matter establish what I would call a prima facie case for concluding that the circumstance referred to in the passage was at least part of the Tribunals reason for affirming the decision under review It is evident that the appellants credibility was a significant factor in the Tribunals thinking and that the passage in question does present an inconsistency between different stories advanced by the appellant at various times albeit perhaps tenderly expressedFor the above reasons I consider that Mr Jenkins first new point would if permitted to be run in this appeal have a reasonable prospect of successConsidering whether this point has a reasonable prospect of success the first question is whether the matter which Mr Jenkins identified was information within the terms of s 424A of the Act  In SZEEU  Moore J at 1820 and apparently Allsop J at 205207 accepted and followed the judgment of Finn and Stone JJ in VAF at 24 In the light of these authorities I should regard information as knowledge of relevant facts or circumstances communicated to or received by the Tribunal but not including subjective appraisals thought processes or determinations or identified gaps defects or lack of detail or specificity in evidence or conclusions arrived at by the Tribunal in weighing up the evidence by reference to those gaps etc In the passage to which I have referred at par 27 above I do not believe that the Tribunal was referring to information as so understood Indeed whether there were any other documents at all was a circumstance of which the Tribunal had no knowledge other than the appellants own assertion Further it was the appellants continued refusal to make good on that assertion thereby the longer that went on making it less likely that there was any information at all that gave the Tribunal cause to point out that his credibility might come into question In this respect the context in which the Tribunal pressed him and warned him should in my view be seen as the identification of gaps defects or lack of detail or specificity in the evidence in relation to the appellants case before the TribunalFurther the very existence of these additional documents was something which lay only in the appellants own assertion before the Tribunal To the extent therefore that there was any information involved here it seems to me that it would inevitably be covered by the exception provided for in par b of subs 3 of s 424AI also accept Mr Reillys submission that the fact that the Tribunal warned the appellant that his continued failure to produce these documents might affect his credibility and recorded the fact of that warning in its decision does not mean that the matter constituted a part of the Tribunals reason for affirming the decision under review In the section of its decision headed Findings and Reasons there is no further reference to this point and to the extent that the Tribunal took the appellants credibility into account and as I have said there were several such occasions this point appears not to have been relevantMr Reilly also submitted that there was a basis upon which the decision of the Tribunal might be justified quite independent of any failure to follow s 424A In this regard he referred to the observation by Allsop J in SZEEU at 231 233 In the hearing before the Tribunal the appellant had identified his brotherinlaw and his family as the ones who were likely to harm him if he returned to that part of India where he previously lived The Tribunal said it was satisfied that if for any reason the appellant did not wish to return to that area he would be able to move elsewhere and live in safety This was Mr Reilly submitted a finding of fact upon which the Tribunal relied in the alternative as a basis for affirming the decision under review and in no respect did it rely upon the Tribunal having recourse to information in relation to which there had been doubtful compliance with s 424A However whatever the merits of this point being an alternative basis for the justification of the decision of the Tribunal as it is I do not think it would be proper to take it into account at the point when I am considering whether the inherent merits of the new points being raised by Mr Jenkins are such that they would have a reasonable prospect of succeeding I shall return to Mr Reillys alternative basis at the appropriate stage of my full consideration of the first pointI turn then to a consideration of Mr Jenkins first new point namely whether the Tribunal failed to comply with s 424A of the Act in relation to the passage for its decision set out at par 6 above As I have said Mr Reilly did not deny that the absence from the appellants protection visa application of the explanation which he later gave for the death of his mother constituted information within the terms of that section The question for determination therefore is whether that information was the reason or part of the reason why the Tribunal affirmed the decision under review In light of the authorities to which I have referred particularly VAF  and the way that judgment was explained in SZEEU  I need to consider carefully the Tribunals decision as a whole I need to be conscious that the Tribunals reasoning may not necessarily be linear and I need to isolate the integral parts of the reasons of the Tribunal paying due regard to the structure layout and arrangement of the printed form of the decision but ultimately identifying those parts at the truly deliberative as distinct from the merely formal level of the Tribunals decisionThe Tribunal commenced its written decision with a short paragraph setting out the factual background to the application before it It referred next to the legislation under which it was operating and to the definition of refugee in the Refugees Convention It set out what it identified as four key elements in the definitionThe next section of the decision was headed Claims and Evidence The Tribunal noted that it had before it the departmental file which included the appellants protection visa application and the record of decision of the delegate It stated that it had also had regard to the material referred to in the delegates decision and other material available to it from a range of sources In this section of the Tribunals decision there are three internal sections each identified by its own subheading They are in order Claims in the protection visa application Claims made in his application for review and Claims made at the hearingI turn finally to the point raised by Mr Reilly to which I have referred at par 34 above He submitted that there was a basis upon which the Tribunals ultimate decision might be affirmed which was entirely independent of the failure to follow s 424A  within the meaning of the judgment of Allsop J in SZEEU 150 FCR 214 233 The basis was that the Tribunal stated that it did not accept that the appellant would be subject to harm at the hands of Ravi and his family no matter where he went to live in India Indeed it did not accept that even if Ravi or members of his family or community stumbled upon the applicant elsewhere in India they would seek to harm him because he came from a minority community or for other Conventionrelated reasons Referring to these findings Mr Reilly submitted that even if everything the appellant claimed about the fear which he held were accepted and even if the nature of that fear could legitimately be linked to the Refugees Convention if the appellant could have safely returned to some other part of India than the village in which his original home was situated it could not be said that he was outside his country of nationality owing to that fearThe difficulty with this submission is that it is immediately confronted by the undoubted circumstance that the Tribunals finding that the appellant could safely return to live in some other part of India could only be made if the appellants own evidence in that regard were disbelieved as it was Indeed in the lengthy paragraph in which the Tribunal dealt with this aspect there were six occasions upon which the Tribunal said that it did not accept particular assertions or evidence on the part of the appellant As I have held above concerns as to the appellants credibility lay at the core of the Tribunals use of the inconsistency as between the two explanations proffered for the death of the appellants mother If the appellants ability to return to India and to live elsewhere than in his original village was an alternative basis providing support for the Tribunals decision on no view could it be said that that basis was entirely independent of the Tribunals failure to follow s 424A of the Act In circumstances there will be a writ of certiorari quashing the Tribunals decision of 24 March 2005 and a writ of mandamus commanding the Tribunal to hear and determine the appellants application for a review of the decision of the delegate according to law  I certify that the preceding seventytwo 72 numbered paragraphs

06_1156.xml,c0,cited,House v The King [1936] HCA 40 ; (1936) 55 CLR 499,6 In the context of the issues raised on the appeal the respondent contends that the above considerations provide a basis for the findings of Federal Magistrate Coker and result in the exercise of a discretion conferred by s 30 of the Act to fix the costs charges expenses and remuneration of the trustee on a basis thought appropriate Consistent with the familiar passage in House v The King 1936 HCA 40  1936 55 CLR 499 and particularly the passage at p 505 of the judgment of their Honours Dixon Evatt and McTiernan JJ the exercise of the discretion ought not to be disturbed The respondent in oral submissions also relied upon s 179 of the Act as the source of the power to fix the amount of the costs expenses and remuneration at 1500000 The appellant contends that s 179 was not relied upon by the respondent in the proceedings before Federal Magistrate Coker was raised for the first time in oral submissions in the hearing of the appeal and the respondent ought not to be allowed to now rely upon s 179 as that section contemplates a particular process which is inconsistent with the conduct of the respondents application and had the respondent relied upon s 179  the appellant would have conducted its response to the application differently Supplementary written submissions have been directed to the question of s 1797 In resolving these competing contentions it has been necessary to closely examine considerable material concerning the precise chronology of events inherent in the administration and the various propositions put to the trustee and the trustees response In dealing with the questions raised on the appeal it is not the role of the appellate court to resolve contested questions of fact However in determining whether the exercise of a power or discretion if conferred miscarried it is necessary to look at the evidence before Federal Magistrate Coker and consider the material in the context of the matters that influenced his Honour to exercise the power in a particular way or to reach particular conclusions8 The appellant seeks leave to amend the notice of appeal and relies upon two affidavits of James Nicholas Conomos filed 23 November 2005 and 29 November 2005 respectively which exhibit an amended notice of appeal and a further amended notice of appeal Although Mr Laurie counsel for the respondent objects to the lateness of the amendments Mr Laurie concedes that the respondent has suffered no prejudice by reason of the late notice of the proposed changes The proposed changes to the amended notice of appeal are not significant Accordingly leave is given to amend the notice of appeal in terms of the document described as Exhibit JNC1 to the affidavit of James Nicholas Conomos filed on 29 November 20059 On 20 June 2003 the Registrar of the Federal Magistrates Court made an order for the sequestration of the estate of Ms Townsend The application was made by Ms Townsends former partner as a result of an unpaid costs order made against Ms Townsend in family law proceedings It seems the solicitors for Ms Townsends former partner were instructed to take all necessary steps to recover the amount of the assessed costs The affidavit evidence suggests that Ms Townsends former partner did not anticipate that such action would result in a sequestration order Nevertheless the amount of the costs remained unpaid after service of the certificate service of a bankruptcy notice and service of an application for a sequestration order The costs remained unpaid at the date of the hearing of the application At the hearing Ms Townsend contended that she was solvent as the value of her assets exceeded the amount due and payable to her creditors including the amount of the costs order10 It is not clear whether any undertaking to discharge the debts within a particular period or by recourse to support from a third party supported by an affidavit to that effect was offered as an element of a request for an adjournment of the hearing of the application In any event the Registrar was satisfied that there was a proper basis for making a sequestration order presumably on the ground that the material in support of the application and the history of a failure to pay or compromise the unpaid costs claim established that Ms Townsend could not pay her debts as and when they fell due for payment notwithstanding the contended surplus of assets over liabilities
06_1156.xml,c1,cited,Duncan v McVeigh & Anor FMCA 759,72 His Honour reached these conclusions   a his Honour was not satisfied that a declaration could be made that the trustee had deliberately contributed to the imposition of excessive charges 8 b his Honour was of the view that there is certainly in my view power to fix a sum in relation to costs in respect of the administration of the estate 8 c it is not possible to make an order pursuant to s 153A or direct the trustee to issue a certificate 10 12 d had the financial circumstances of the respondent been properly considered at the time of hearing the creditors petition there would have been some consideration given to adjourning the petition 16 e the contention that the value of Ms Townsends assets exceeded her identified liabilities makes it clear that the applicant was in a position of solvency His Honour relies upon the decisions of Reithmuller FM in Duncan v McVeigh  Anor FMCA 759 and Spender J in Re McDonald ex parte The Deputy Commissioner of Taxation 1996 33 ATR 1 Those decisions of course both recognise the importance of an undertaking to pay the costs of the trustees administration and the need for the court to be satisfied that by reason of any asset surplus the bankrupt is able to pay his or her debts 17 22 f within a short period of time the debts due to creditors had been paid by the bankrupt and some clarification of the position with regard to securing an annulment was sought 22 g during the administration a fundamental breakdown in the relationship between the trustee and Ms Townsend occurred h at 23 24 and 25 his Honour quotes extensive passages from the trustees letter dated 10 February 2004 to Ms Townsend and in reliance upon at least in part those passages his Honour concludes that it is most disturbing that a certificate has not issued pursuant to s 153A notwithstanding that the creditors have been paid 26  the trustees position is that it is impossible to issue a certificate whilst the possibility of a private prosecution or complaint remains outstanding 26  the actions of the trustee are unprofessional 27  and as an apparent explanation of that conclusion his Honour says the proper course on the part of the trustee would have been to bring the matter to a prompt finalisation 27 and that result was not reached because the approaches by the applicant to a serious extent were unable to be dealt with as a result of the trustees very determined efforts to ensure that no complaint could be brought in relation to the conduct by him of the administration 27   i the trustee by reason of the letter of 10 February 2004 quite obviously attempted to force any consideration by the applicant of the proceedings now before the court not to be brought because of the financial influence and effect of those proceedings 28 j extremely excessive costs have been incurred as a result of the failure to bring this matter to a successful conclusion 29 and k At 29 and 30 these observations    29 I am concerned as to further costs being incurred in relation to these proceedings and to what I consider to have been extremely excessive charges incurred as a result of the failure to bring this matter to a successful conclusion I am mindful of the terms of the letter of 10 February 2004 and in particular the indications as to costs expended and expectations in relation to future to costs In my view that was the appropriate time to bring this matter to an end To suggest that the bankruptcy could never be annulled whilst there was some possibility of a disgruntled client complaining as to the administration of the estate is bullying in the extreme and is inappropriate       30 I intend to fix the trustees costs in relation to the administration of the estate at 1500000 taking into consideration the amounts already paid and the estimates contained within the correspondence of 10 February 200473 His Honour concluded that the respondent was then and at all times solvent and the proper course was to annul the bankruptcy pursuant to s 153B of the Act74 The immediate difficulty with his Honours conclusions and findings is that they do not arise out of an exposed analysis of the evidence no doubt because his Honour was seeking to expeditiously dispose of a controversy with a long history75 However there are two reasons on the evidence why the trustee had refused to reach a state of satisfaction required by s 153A of the Act The first was that notwithstanding the payment of 1000000 by Ms Townsend or those assisting her having regard to the letters of 25 November 2003 see 33 34 and 35 27 November 2003 36 28 November 2003 37 and 10 February 2004 41 a further amount as at 10 February 2004 of 230000 would be required to meet the cost of work undertaken from 13 December 2003 to that date and the additional tasks necessary to finalise the administration The second consideration involved the question of whether further costs would be incurred by the trustee in responding to complaints and allegations and a threatened private prosecution or other proceedings76 As to the first reason the trustee on 10 February 2004 said that remuneration for work done from 13 December 2003 having regard to the fact that the report to creditors was dated 12 December 2003 and the completion of the earlier billing period was 11 December 2003 was approximately 130000 plus GST plus 58000 for expenses plus GST that is approximately 206800 The trustee suggested a further amount of 220000 would fairly represent the value of that work77 In addition further identified steps to complete the administration would be necessary see paragraph 3 of the letter of 10 February 2004 41 The trustee said in the letter of 10 February 2004 that he held 110090 being the 1000000 received less remuneration of 809910 and less the 8 ITSA realisation fee of 80000 and upon receipt of a further 230000 including GST the Government charges on retransmitting Ms Townsends land and the 8 ITSA charge the trustee could draw down all or the major part of the cost to complete prepare or lodge any land transfer forms and issue an annulment certificate under s 153A of the Bankruptcy Act   In other words a total amount of 340090 would complete the administration satisfy all relevant costs charges expenses and remuneration and result in an annulment certificate Having regard to the 1000000 already paid and its application the additional 230000 would result in an annulment certificate based upon costs charges expenses and remuneration including GST Government charges and ITSA charges of 1230000 in all78 Ms Townsend refused to pay any further contribution and on 24 February 2004 filed the application the subject of these proceedings
06_1156.xml,c2,cited,Bellin v Pattison (Trustee) [1999] FCA 51,90 His Honour concluded that the matters set out in the final five paragraphs of the letter of 10 February 2004 as set out at 41 represented an attempt to force any consideration of Ms Townsends application to the court to be brought to an end and represented the expression of extreme and inappropriate bullying Those conclusions cannot stand in the face of the evidence for a number of reasons First Ms Townsend had indicated that her disposition was not to press complaints so as to facilitate the resolution of the administration and accordingly the formulation of the costs at 10 February 2004 by the trustee of an additional 230000 recognised that no costs would be incurred in the administration in connection with any matters of complaint Had those monies been paid a s 153A certificate would have duly issued effecting an annulment Secondly although the response of the trustee to the allegations of complaint might be regarded as robust the trustee was nevertheless entitled to respond to complaints which he perceived to be misconceived and unmeritorious either because the assessment by the bankrupt of the reasonableness of proposed fees was not founded upon any proper basis or because allegations of abuses were not in the trustees view correct see Bellin v Pattison Trustee 1999 FCA 51 at 18 to 2291 A bankrupt concerned about the conduct of a trustee might invoke an inquiry into the conduct of the trustee pursuant to s 179 and seek to bring the scope of the trustees conduct within the supervision of the court In undertaking such an inquiry the court might form a view that particular conduct involved a breach of duty and make an order that the trustee be removed from office or make an order disentitling the trustee to an indemnity out of the estate assets in respect of any costs charges and expenses incurred in breach of duty or an order disentitling the trustee to particular remuneration92 The proceedings before Federal Magistrate Coker sought an annulment of the bankruptcy on the ground that all debts of the bankrupt had been paid and that s 153A of the Act conferred a power upon the court to annul the bankruptcy Secondly the respondent contended that because the sequestration order ought not to have been made the bankruptcy ought to be annulled No challenge was made to the conduct of the trustee in reliance upon a power in the court to inquire into the conduct of the trustee for the purposes of s 179 of the Act I accept the submission of the appellant that the relief sought and the foundation for the relief was directed to annulment of the bankruptcy arising out of the contended discharge of all debts of the bankrupt and a contention that the sequestration order ought not to have been made The application did not proceed nor was it conducted on the footing that the court was conducting an inquiry into the conduct of the trustee The first aspect of the application involved an order by his Honour that the costs both expenses and remuneration of the trustee be taxed to determine the body of fair and reasonable costs in the expectation that a resolution of that matter would in all probability result in a position where a certificate might issue thus annulling the bankruptcy by operation of s 153A of the Act Within the forum of the taxation of the costs the conduct of the trustee both in terms of the steps taken by him and his staff and the charges allocated for those steps was to be the subject of examination The proceeding before the court was not however an inquiry for the purposes of s 179 of the Act and it is not now appropriate to determine the questions on appeal on the footing of s 17993 A third reason why the conclusions reached by his Honour concerning the position adopted by the trustee in relation to existing and future complaints by Ms Townsend cannot stand is that the trustee put the proposition that Ms Townsend might consider withdrawing threats of action or complaint expressly on the basis that if they were to be pursued the trustee might either apply to the court for a release or alternatively apply to the court for directions as to how the allegations might be dealt with In addition the trustee recommended that if Ms Townsend thought the suggestion of the trustee that a private prosecution might not be pursued was in the circumstances an improper suggestion Ms Townsend may choose to seek legal advice specifically on that matter The assessment of the costs incurred by the trustee reveal that in the period from 20 June 2003 to 5 November 2004 the costs of dealing with complaints lodged by Ms Townsend with bankruptcy regulators amounted to 52342 subject to the addition of GST and an 8 realisation charge94 His Honour relied upon s 153B in making an order annulling the bankruptcy and setting aside the sequestration order based upon a finding that Ms Townsend was at the date of the sequestration order solvent and at all material times remained solvent Section 1541a provides that all acts done by the trustee or any person acting under the authority of the trustee before the annulment are taken to have been validly made or done subject to considerations of breach of duty and s 1541b provides that the trustee may apply the property of the former bankrupt still vested in the trustee in payment of the costs charges and expenses of the administration of the bankruptcy including the remuneration and expenses of the trustee His Honour made a further order fixing the remuneration of the trustee and concluded that the court certainly had power to fix a sum in relation to the costs in respect of the administration of the estate 8 although the source of that power was not identified Whatever the source of the power may be the foundation for the exercise of the power was that the trustee ought to have concluded the administration on or about 10 February 2004 and that having regard to that circumstance the costs ought to have been 150000095 No such foundation existed and the exercise of the power therefore failed96 As to the source of the power it cannot be found in s 153B or any provision of Division 5 of Part VII of the Act Division 4 of Part VIII of the Act addresses the topic of Control over trustees Section 178 of the Act within Division 4 contains the heading  Appeal to court against trustees decision  and is in these terms   1781 Right of appeal If the bankrupt a creditor or any other person is affected by an act omission or decision of the trustee he or she may apply to the court and the court may make such order in the manner as it thinks just and equitable   1782 Time limit The application must be made not later than 60 days after the day on which the person became aware of the trustees act omission or decision97 Plainly enough the application to the court made by Ms Townsend on 24 February 2004 did not expressly raise the notion of an appeal from a decision of the trustee Ms Townsends application was signed on 16 February 2004 and filed on 24 February 2004 within 14 days of the letter from the trustee dated 10 February 2004 seeking a further sum of 230000 in order to bring the administration of the estate to a conclusion and facilitate the issue of a certificate and in consequence an annulment of the bankruptcy Although the precise character of an act omission or decision of the trustee is not clear s 1781 may well be sufficiently broad in its formulation to confer power upon the court to make such order as the court thinks just and equitable in relation to the request by the trustee for the provision of further monies in respect of costs both expenses and remuneration incurred from 13 December 2003 to 10 February 2004 and in respect of those costs to be incurred in undertaking steps necessary to complete the administration98 Because his Honour failed to have regard to the evidence no proper foundation subsisted for the exercise of a power to fix costs The discretion has miscarried but to the extent that the source of the power might need to be identified it seems to me that s 1781 may well confer a power to determine or fix the quantum of the costs both expenses and remuneration in respect of an administration In addition s 301b of the Act confers a power upon the court to make such orders as the court considers necessary for the purposes of carrying out or giving effect to the Act in any case or matter The intersection however between the exercise of such powers directed to the subject matter of the trustees remuneration and the proper application of s 162 of the Act which specifically addresses the mechanisms by which the trustees remuneration is to be determined must be carefully considered in any particular case The trustees remuneration might be determined by resolution of the creditors or by a committee of inspection Where the remuneration of the trustee is not so determined the trustee is to be remunerated as prescribed by the regulations s 1624 The making of an order to fix or otherwise determine the remuneration of the trustee in the exercise of a power which properly comprehends such subject matter notwithstanding the preparation of an itemised Bill of Costs and the taxation of those costs could only arise out of an exposed process of reasoning identifying a proper basis for recourse to such power There is no such process of exposed reasoning identified99 Accordingly the orders made by Federal Magistrate Coker on 22 April 2005 that the costs of the administration of the estate of the applicant including the transfer back to the applicant of any real property be fixed in the sum of 1500000 and that there be no order as to costs in relation to the proceedings before this Court must be set aside Because the request of the trustee on 10 February 2004 for a further amount of 230000 in order to complete the administration was fair and reasonable having regard to all the evidence with the result that the trustee was entitled to form the view that the debts of the bankrupt had not been fully paid by reason of the controversy concerning the costs charges expenses and remuneration of the administration it necessarily follows that the rejection of that request and the election to commence proceedings is the true source of the additional costs100 Before setting out the proposed orders it should be noted that the matters before Federal Magistrate Coker on 5 November 2004 and subsequently on 15 February 2005 involved a challenge to the refusal of the trustee to issue a certificate for the purposes of s 153A an examination of the requests by the trustee for the provision of funds in connection with the administration of the estate and a consideration of whether the bankruptcy ought to be annulled pursuant to s 153B Although Federal Magistrate Coker determined that the bankruptcy ought to be annulled on the ground of the solvency of the applicant a substantial part of the proceeding involved a consideration of evidence going to the first limb of the application as to whether a certificate ought to have issued on the part of the trustee and whether the court had power to direct an annulment in circumstances where a factual contention that all debts of the bankrupt including the costs both expenses and remuneration had been paid by a certain date was resolved in favour of the applicant The applicant was successful on the second limb of the application Accordingly any costs arising out of or in connection with the hearing which now might be the subject of an order ought to be limited to those matters arising out of or in connection with the first limb of the application

06_1168.xml,c0,referred_to,Australian Broadcasting Commission v Parish and Ors (1980) 43 FLR 129,In Australian Broadcasting Commission v Parish and Ors 1980 43 FLR 129 Bowen CJ stated at 1323   Under s 50 an order may be made forbidding or restricting the publication of particular evidence or the name of a party or witness where it appears to the court to be necessary in order to prevent prejudice to the administration of justice or the security of the Commonwealth Again we are familiar with cases where an order forbidding or restricting publication is appropriate Thus where the proceedings concern a secret process and publication of the process would destroy the subject matter of the proceedings and render them nugatory an order is necessary to prevent prejudice to the administration of justice Where proceedings are brought to restrain publication of confidential material similar considerations apply Disclosure would prejudice the courts proper exercise of the function it was appointed to discharge to do justice between the parties The possible cases where an order may be necessary to prevent prejudice to the administration of justice range fairly widely The categories of this public interest are not closed and must alter from time to time whether by restriction or extension as social conditions and legislation develop see D v National Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Children 1978 AC 171 at 230 per Lord Hailsham  Science Research Council v Nass 1979 3 WLR 762 at 784 per Lord Fraser Bowen CJ added at 133 that  Open justice is the underlying assumption of s 50   Deane J observed at 158   The decision whether an order under s 50 should be made will be the outcome of a balancing process in respect of which there will commonly be room for differences of opinion as to the weight to be attached to particular factors to be placed in the balance and in the result as to the precise outcome of the process itselfThe Australian Prudential Regulation Authority APRA has provided six reasons in support of the continuation of order 8 and denial of access under O 46 r 63 of the Federal Court Rules  Firstly it says that certain documents have not been admitted into evidence Secondly it says that certain documents contain information which it would be an offence to disclose under s 562 of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Act 1998 Cth APRA Act Thirdly it says that certain documents were supplied to the applicant subject to nondisclosure conditions under s 565b of the APRA Act Fourthly it says certain documents are subject to a duty of confidentiality pursuant to s 60 of the Insurance Act 1973 Cth Fifthly it says that certain documents contain information about third parties the disclosure of which may damage reputations or result in a denial of procedural fairness by APRA Sixthly it says that certain documents disclose the investigative processes of APRAApart from the question of statutory prohibition these documents were provided by the respondent to the applicant on a confidential basis Documents which the Court could not have ordered be provided to a party or to the Court and which are provided voluntarily on a confidential basis to a party should not in my opinion be released to nonparties by the Court I note the observations of Deane J in Parish at 157 that   The interests of the administration of justice plainly make it desirable that obligations of confidence be not lightly overruled and that legitimate expectations of confidentiality as to private and confidential transactions and affairs be not lightly disregarded Further I consider that any documents which contain information derived from documents subject to s 56 of the APRA Act should remain the subject of an order under s 50 except where that information is otherwise in the public domain Although documents created by the applicant in response to the reports may not in all cases be themselves covered by the operation of s 56 it would in my opinion undermine the operation of s 56 if they were not also restrained from publication Further it would be likely that organisations such as APRA would cease to provide such documents to external interested parties if they could not ensure that confidentiality of the material contained within them would be maintainedI accept that in some circumstances documents which disclose the investigative processes of APRA might be appropriately restrained from publication In the present case however having considered those documents which fall outside the restrictions already discussed I do not consider that the material contains significant details which would prejudice APRAs conduct of future investigations if it were publicly revealed Accordingly I do not consider that any additional material should be withheld by order under s 50 on the basis that it reveals APRAs investigative processesIn respect of the suggestion that a duty of confidentiality applies by virtue of s 60 of the Insurance Act 1973 Cth I agree with this submission but only to a limited extent I accept that information relating to the contents of the final report would be subject to a duty of confidentiality on the basis that publication is prohibited without the agreement of the AttorneyGeneral It is possible that this duty would extend also to the contents of the draft reports but it is unnecessary to decide this point at present since s 56 of the APRA Act applies to the draft reports However I do not consider that s 60 of the Insurance Act would prevent the applicant disclosing his knowledge of the investigation by APRA outside of these parametersI have read the file and considered the documents contained in it I propose to amend order 8 of the orders of 14 July 2006 to restrict its operation to those portions of the documents which I believe fall into one of the two categories referred to above namely documents to which s 56 of the APRA Act applies or documents derived from documents to which s 56 applies Because of the nature of the documents in question I have prepared a schedule of those documents to which I consider the s 50 order should continue to apply Any further documents filed in the proceedings will need to be subject to consideration on a casebycase basis

06_1168.xml,c4,referred_to,Llewellyn v Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 836,I do not consider that the first reason provides a basis for excluding documents under s 50 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 Cth Given the principle of open justice the fact that documents have not been admitted into evidence would not be sufficient to justify a prohibition on their publication In Llewellyn v Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd 2006 FCA 836 Rares J observed at 27   The proposition that untested allegations in civil proceedings are somehow to be shielded from public view merely because they are untested allegations and could only possibly be properly understood in the context of a fully contested hearing is in my opinion not one that can sit with the principle of open justice or the right of anyone fairly to report proceedings in a court of justiceRares J was dealing with an application which sought to restrain access by the media to pleadings filed in proceedings Pleadings are subject to O 46 r 61 Third parties are entitled to access pleadings unless the Court has ordered that they are confidential The case law relating to documents subject to O 46 r 62 is somewhat different Nonetheless the principle which emerges from the above is the fact that material contains allegations which are untested this does not of itself justify an order under s 50For similar reasons I do not consider that the fifth reason proposed by APRA is sufficient to justify the continuation of an order under s 50 Unfortunate though it may be the fact that the reputations of certain individuals may be damaged by documents is not of itself a reason for restricting their publication by an order under s 50 The damage to an individual must be weighed against the importance of maintaining open justice and public confidence in the justice system As Rares J observed in Llewellyn at 23   Ordinary members of the public are well aware of the difference between allegations made in courts and findings made by courtsHowever I consider that the second and third reasons suggested by APRA relating to the prohibitions contained in s 56 of the APRA Act are significant In my opinion it would prejudice the administration of justice if documents were revealed to which restrictions under s 56 of the APRA Act applied The Court cannot require the production of these documents and they were provided to the applicant and to the Court subject to confidentiality requirements It would vitiate my decision of 26 May 2006 relating to the effect of that section if those documents which were  protected documents  or contained  protected information  were allowed to be published by the CourtI agree with Rares J in Llewellyn that the approach adopted in the Supreme Court of New South Wales in which different rules apply is different from the approach adopted by the rules of this Court see at 21 and 22 of his Honours judgment Pursuant to O 46 r 61 of the Federal Court Rules  a nonparty will generally be entitled to access the pleadings Accordingly I do not consider the comments of Santow J in eisa Ltd v Brady and Ors 2000 NSWSC 929 at 20 are applicable to this Court in so far as they apply to pleadings However in respect of affidavit material which has not been read in Court the comments of Santow J in respect of affidavits accord with the principle outlined by Sackville J in Macquarie Radio and Seven Network

an abandonment of the claim for protection regarding abandonment see AttorneyGeneral for the Northern Territory v Maurice at 498 per Dawson J26 The claimed waiver in the present case relates to documents seized pursuant to two different search warrants which were executed some months apart The first search warrant was executed on the Concord premises several months before the documents which are the subject of the present application were seized from Dimocks The second search warrant was executed on the Rosebery premises several months after the Dimocks documents were seized Different considerations may apply to the documents seized in each of these two searches and in my opinion it is appropriate that they be considered separately27 The warrant at the Concord premises was executed on 20 May 2005 at which time documents 1b 1d 1i and 1m were seized The applicant made no claim for legal professional privilege in relation to those documents at that time or subsequently In fact the applicant has never made a claim for legal professional privilege specifically in relation to the documents seized on 20 May 2005 Rather the claim is made in respect of the documents seized from Dimocks28 The search of Dimocks occurred on 11 November 2005 almost six months after the Concord premises had been searched Mr Dimock made a claim for legal professional privilege at the time of the search and on 18 November 2005 these proceedings were commenced However in the preceding six months the applicant had made no claim for legal professional privilege in respect of the Concord documents several of which were identical to the Dimocks documents29 The applicant submits that she was unaware of her right to claim legal professional privilege She points out that a copy of the document outlining the right to claim legal professional privilege was given to her husband but not to her She submits also that the PSR which was completed in relation to the Concord search did not describe the documents sufficiently such that it was not clear that the documents seized were documents to which privilege was likely to attach She submits that in these circumstances the fact that she took no action to assert a claim for privilege was not inconsistent with the continuance of the privilege42 In my opinion that conduct is inconsistent with the continuation of privilege in the documents seized I recognise that the right to maintain the confidentiality of legal advice attaches to the applicant rather than to her legal advisor see Mann v Carnell at 28 However in this case the applicant had instructed Mr OBrien to advise her in relation to the privilege claim Mr OBrien having knowledge of the seized documents from both Dimocks and the Rosebery premises did not make a claim for privilege on her behalf The fact that the documents were being held pending a claim for privilege was drawn to his attention by the facsimile from the AFP He did not then make a claim for legal professional privilege and accordingly abandoned Robert Normans claim for privilege The situation is analogous to that considered by the Supreme Court of New South Wales in Spedley  where Cole J observed at 729     I am of the opinion that the conduct of Bank of New Zealand in sitting by with knowledge that material to which a claim for privilege could be made was being used  and yet taking no steps to make a claim of privilege on behalf of Bank of New Zealand  does constitute waiver of legal professional privilege   Messrs Freehill Hollingdale  Page were advising Bank of New Zealand regarding the 25 million claim Litigation obviously was a possibility if not a probability In those circumstances a solicitor is the agent of his client in all matters that may reasonably be expected to arise for decision in the cause per Denning LJ in Griffiths v Evans 1953 1 WLR 1424 at 1431

06_1170.xml,c7,applied,House v The King [1936] HCA 40 ; (1936) 55 CLR 499,18 The decision by Raphael FM to dismiss the appellants case as an abuse of process was an exercise of discretion by his Honour Accordingly I must be guided by the principles expressed in House v The King 1936 HCA 40  1936 55 CLR 499 in relation to an appeal from an exercise of discretion In that case Dixon Evatt and McTiernan JJ said at 5045  The manner in which an appeal against an exercise of discretion should be determined is governed by established principles It is not enough that the judges composing the appellate court consider that if they had been in the position of the primary judge they would have taken a different course It must appear that some error has been made in exercising the discretion If the judge acts upon a wrong principle if he allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect him if he mistakes the facts if he does not take into account some material consideration then his determination should be reviewed and the appellate court may exercise its own discretion in substitution for his if it has the materials for doing so It may not appear how the primary judge has reached the result embodied in his order but if upon the facts it is unreasonable or plainly unjust the appellate court may infer that in some way there has been a failure properly to exercise the discretion which the law reposes in the court of first instance In such a case although the nature of the error may not be discoverable the exercise of the discretion is reviewed on the ground that a substantial wrong has in fact occurred19 The appellants notice of appeal and his submissions relate primarily to the substantive merits of his judicial review application rather than to the question whether the dismissal as an abuse of process was an error of law which is the proper question in this appeal However the correct issue was squarely raised in the judgment of Edmonds J relating to leave to appeal and has been dealt with in the submissions of the first respondent In view of the fact that the appellant is unrepresented and does not speak English and of the importance of the matters in dispute I consider it appropriate that the Court consider this issue even though it has not been specifically raised in the notice of appeal20 At this hearing the appellant provided some evidence relating to the reasons for discontinuing the Adelaide proceedings and for the delay in instituting these proceedings However whilst I consider the appellant to have been a generally reliable witness I do not consider that I can take fresh evidence on these matters into account in determining whether his Honours discretion miscarried21 There are two questions of principle which I consider are raised by the judgment of Raphael FM The first is whether his Honour misinterpreted the authorities in respect of dismissal for abuse of process in determining that the application should be dismissed The second is the question of whether Raphael FM could properly take into account the fault of the migration agent if proven in determining how to exercise his discretion37 It is clear from House v The King that having found that Raphael FMs discretion miscarried I may reexercise the discretion if in a position to do so see the passage reproduced at 18 above Given that the transcript of the proceedings before Raphael FM is in evidence and based upon his Honours factual findings contained in his reasons for judgment I consider that I am in a position to do so38 Raphael FM did not make any specific factual finding in respect of the behaviour of the appellants migration agent However as referred to at 36 above it is clear from his Honours reasons that he was concerned by the appellants evidence about the agent His Honour considered these allegations of misconduct were sufficiently credible to warrant a referral of the file and the transcript to the Migration Agents Review Panel In my opinion his Honours concerns should weigh against the striking out of the appellants application as an abuse of process39 I also consider the fact that the appellant has not had a merits hearing to be significant This is a factor which as discussed above was not fully taken into account by Raphael FM in his consideration In my opinion this is also a significant factor weighing against the striking out of the application40 A third factor to consider is the appellants delay in bringing his application for a review of the Tribunals decision The current application was filed in January 2005 over 26 months after the Tribunals decision was handed down On its face this period of delay is significant and in some circumstances with no justification might be sufficient of itself to warrant a dismissal However if the appellants claims are believed the delay attributable to the misconduct of the migration agent would account for at least 18 months Raphael FM did not make any specific findings on the credibility of the appellant The respondent has pointed to an exchange between the appellants migration agent and Raphael FM contained in the transcript as follows  MIGRATION AGENT This is as well actually thats why I dont think its an abuse of process here because the person was clearly unaware of the failure of his application   HIS HONOUR He said he was but hes been crossexamined at some length and Im afraid I dont really quite believe him but I dont know whether he was cheated by the other migration agent or he wasnt and I am going to refer the matter to the MARA people and they can sort it out  This statement is ambiguous and no adverse finding is recorded in his Honours reasons Further his Honour clearly believed enough of the appellants evidence to refer the matter to the Migration Agents Review Panel Given these circumstances I do not think the above exchange can be considered determinative and I consider the appellant should be given the benefit of the doubt41 In all of the circumstances I do not believe that this is a case which warrants dismissal as an abuse of process Given the allegations of misconduct by the appellants migration agent which appear to me and which evidently appeared to Raphael FM to have some substance and given that the appellant has not had the opportunity to have the merits of his appeal heard I consider that the matter should be allowed to proceed Accordingly I will order that the respondents notice of motion seeking strike out of the appeal be dismissed and that the matter be remitted to the Federal Magistrates Court for determination  I certify that the preceding fortyone 41 numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Cowdroy  AssociateDated 8

06_1172.xml,c5,referred_to,Kioa and Ors v West and Anor [1985] HCA 81 ; (1985) 159 CLR 550,The content of procedural fairness requirements will depend upon the circumstances of the exercise of the power see Wilson J in Kioa and Ors v West and Anor 1985 HCA 81  1985 159 CLR 550 at 5845 per Mason J 601 per Wilson J 6112 per Brennan J 633 per Deane J However common law procedural fairness will generally require that an applicant be given the opportunity to comment upon information held by the Tribunal which is adverse to his or her interest As Mason J said in Kioa at 582   It is a fundamental rule of the common law doctrine of natural justice expressed in traditional terms that generally speaking when an order is to be made which will deprive a person of some right or interest or the legitimate expectation of a benefit he is entitled to know the case sought to be made against him and to be given an opportunity of replying to it I do not accept this submission The obligations of procedural fairness at common law relate to two rules the bias rule and the hearing rule see M Aronson B Dyer and M Groves Judicial Review of Administrative Action  3 rd ed Lawbook Co 2004 at 370 The bias rule prevents a Tribunal from acting in a way which shows actual or apprehended bias towards an applicant The hearing rule acts to ensure that an individual is given an opportunity to be heard before a decision is taken and to meet the case which is put against him or her see the passage in Kioa cited at 19 above The precise content of the hearing rule is dependent upon the context in which the decision is being made In any event if an allegation of procedural fairness is to be made out the applicant must demonstrate that either the bias rule or the hearing rule has been breached by the TribunalThe decision of the Tribunal to publish its reasons upon the internet in the form in which it did so could not vitiate the decision which had already been made by the Tribunal relating to the applicants refugee status No suggestion has been made that the Tribunals decision to publish its reasons indicated bias on the part of the Tribunal Nor is there any suggestion that the hearing given by the Tribunal had been in some way deficient If a breach of neither of these principles is alleged a claim of procedural unfairness is not made out

06_1172.xml,c10,followed,Stead v State Government Insurance Commission [1986] HCA 54 ; (1986) 161 CLR 141,In arriving at this conclusion I am mindful of the observations of the High Court in Stead v State Government Insurance Commission 1986 HCA 54  1986 161 CLR 141 In that case the Court considered the circumstances in which it was appropriate not to order a new trial because it would inevitably result in the making of the same order as that made at the first trial Whilst the Court observed that  not every departure from the rules of natural justice at a trial will entitle the aggrieved party to a new trial  it cautioned at 145   Where however the denial of natural justice affects the entitlement of a party to make submissions on an issue of fact  it is more difficult for a court of appeal to conclude that compliance with the requirements of natural justice could have made no difference  when the Full Court is invited by a respondent to exercise these powers in order to arrive at a conclusion that a new trial sought to remedy a denial of natural justice relevant to a finding of fact could make no difference to the result already reached it should proceed with caution The procedural unfairness alleged in the present case is directed to a finding of fact namely a finding as to the applicants credibility However I am nonetheless satisfied that this is a case in which the provision of the information could have made no difference to the result because the applicants credibility was determined in his favourThe Tribunal made no adverse findings on the applicants credibility but rather believed his factual account The applicant submitted that the Tribunal impliedly made adverse credibility findings because it did not find that he had a wellfounded fear of persecution However the examples pointed to by the applicant were those in which the Tribunal did not agree with the applicants assessment of events not where it disbelieved his account of the facts The Tribunal accepted that the applicant and his brothers and cousins had been detained by the Libyan government It accepted his description of what had occurred at his place of work and the details of his education What it did not agree with was the applicants explanation for these events While the applicant believed that they resulted from religious persecution the Tribunal disagreed The Tribunal did not believe the applicant was lying about the facts It just considered that he was wrong in his interpretation of them In terms of the applicants credibility the Tribunal clearly found in the applicants favourThe material contained in the file note was credible relevant and significant only in respect of the issue of the applicants credibility It could not have been relevant to any of the other findings made by the Tribunal The Tribunals decision did not include any adverse findings upon the applicants credibility but rather was based upon its assessment of his risk of persecution in Libya derived from independent country information and from its assessment of his personal circumstances Giving the applicant an opportunity to comment upon the file note could not possibly have altered the Tribunals findings in respect of matters unrelated to his credibilityFor these reasons I consider that this ground must also be rejected Regardless of whether a breach of procedural fairness has in fact occurred I consider that to order the matter to be remitted to the Tribunal would be futile and if a breach of procedural fairness were in fact established I would exercise my discretion not to order a rehearing Accordingly this ground must fail

addressed the question of whether Irlmond and APS were insolvent at the time receivers were appointed Mr Spalla contended that the companies were not insolvent at that time His Honour held however that the fact that the companies were insolvent is an inescapable conclusion from the evidence see Spalla No 1 at 1408 Mr Spalla appealed against the decision of Finkelstein J to the Full Court The Full Court which was constituted by Heerey Sundberg and Weinberg JJ upheld his Honours decision see Spalla v St George Wholesale Finance Pty Ltd 1999 FCA 1566  Spalla No 2  The Full Court held amongst other things that the primary judge was correct to find that Irlmond and APS were insolvent at the time receivers were appointed see Spalla No 2 at 61709 In proceeding V 7877 of 1999 St George Wholesale Finance unsuccessfully petitioned for a sequestration order against Mr Spalla based on an alleged failure to comply with a bankruptcy notice The notice claimed that Mr Spalla owed a debt pursuant to the judgment obtained in proceeding V 74 of 1999 before Finkelstein J Mr Spalla contested the sum specified In St George Wholesale Finance Pty Ltd v Spalla 2000 FCA 1094 at 40  41  Heerey J concluded that St George is not sure itself what is really owing under the judgment and that this proceeding amounts to an abuse of the procedures provided by the Act27 The primary proceeding began on 17 October 2002 when Still  Co filed the original application and statement of claim on behalf of the then applicants Those applicants were Mr Spalla and his wife Stella Mr Still and Anstella Nominees Pty Ltd Anstella as the holder of all shares in Irlmond and APS Irlmond was not one of the original parties to the primary proceeding The original respondents included St George Motor Finance St George Wholesale Finance Messrs Beck and Home and Deloittes By their original statement of claim the applicants alleged that the respondents had given false evidence in the proceeding before Finkelstein J and raised various claims relating to the receivership of Irlmond and APS The applicants also claimed that the respondents had conspired wrongly to subject Mr Spalla and Mr Still to criminal conspiracy charges28 Prior to May 2003 Mr Rambaldi retained the firm of Darrer Muir Fleiter to advise him with respect to the primary proceeding and in particular as to Irlmonds prospects if it were to join in the proceeding On 22 November 2002 Mr Rambaldi sought quotations for insurance litigation funding In a facsimile dated 3 February 2003 Mr Rambaldis solicitors subsequently wrote to Mr Spallas solicitors stating that as liquidator of Irlmond Mr Rambaldi was not in a position to join in the primary proceeding or institute his own proceeding until he had entered into an acceptable funding arrangement although Mr Rambaldi had his own legal advice that various claims against the Respondents or a combination of them are likely to be successful29 Throughout February and March 2003 Mr Rambaldi assisted by Mr Vasudevan negotiated with IMF Australia Ltd IMF represented by Mr Clive Bowman to secure litigation funding and in particular concerning the terms of a litigation funding agreement which Mr Rambaldi required before agreeing to Irlmond becoming an applicant in the primary proceeding The contemporaneous correspondence shows that control of the litigation was an important issue By a letter dated 6 March 2003 IMF specifically noted that it wanted to avoid Spalla attempting to block or interfere with a settlement which Irlmond wishes to pursue It reiterated this concern in an email of 29 April 2003 Ultimately a funding agreement was reached with Insolvency Litigation Fund Pty Ltd ILF a wholly owned subsidiary of IMF Before concluding the funding agreement Mr Spalla retained the services of Mr Borden to act on his behalf in place of Still  Co32 At the hearing of the motion on 8 May 2003 Finkelstein J allowed Mr Iain Jones as counsel for two of the St George parties in their capacity as creditors of Irlmond to appear and make submissions Mr Jones argued that the agreement as then drafted improperly limited the liquidators discretion to settle claims on behalf of Irlmond Mr Jones noted that clauses 13 and 14 of the proposed funding agreement allowed the Spalla Interests to object to the liquidator accepting a settlement offer made only to Irlmond and in the event of such an objection delegated to an arbitrator the decision whether to accept such an offer Mr Jones claimed that this arrangement was an unlawful restraint on the liquidators discretion His Honour said that it appeared that Mr Jones was correct on this point Mr Jones also argued that the proposed funding agreement which allowed ILF to withdraw at any time on seven days notice but still take part in a distribution of any recovery gave ILF a potential windfall if it withdrew shortly after executing the agreement33 After the hearing of 8 May 2006 the parties to the proposed funding agreement negotiated further in order to amend it so as to meet the concerns expressed by Finkelstein J In particular as part of these further negotiations the parties considered the issue of control over any settlement offer to Irlmond and the issue of ILF getting a windfall if it withdrew its indemnity shortly after executing the agreement They prepared a new draft funding agreement On 12 May 2003 Mr Rambaldi filed this new draft in the Court together with counsels supplementary submission in support of the new agreement34 This supplementary submission stated that the amendments to the proposed funding agreement address the criticisms made by Mr Jones It continued The effect of the amendments is to    a remove any restriction on the power of the liquidator to accept a settlement offer made to the company No limitations are imposed upon the liquidator at all in this regard  b in the event that ILF terminates its indemnity pursuant to clause 62 to restrict the entitlement of ILF to the Recovery to simply a reimbursement of monies it has paid pursuant to clause 6235 The new agreement deleted the former clauses 13 and 14 from the earlier draft Clause 9 relating to control of the proceedings was unchanged except clause 14 was substituted for the words clause 13 in clause 93 A new clause 13 dealt with Recoveries A new clause 14 relevantly read  14 DISPUTE RESOLUTION

06_1177.xml,c7,referred_to,Rambaldi v Spalla [2005] VSC 162,115 The application was heard by Hansen J on 6 May 2005 Mr Randall appeared for Mr Rambaldi Mr Spalla appeared in person Mr Randall said that although Mr Rambaldi had come to Court to put the option of allowing the officers of Irlmond to take over the litigation his preference is that the court declines to make the orders Mr Spalla spoke also He expressed disapproval of how Mr Rambaldi had acted in signing the Deed and said that he wished to take control of the litigation At the conclusion of the hearing his Honour declined to make the orders sought and gave reasons see Rambaldi v Spalla 2005 VSC 162  Rambaldi 116 Hansen J found that he had insufficient information to form a view on the likelihood of success of Irlmond on appeal or at trial Rambaldi at 19 Therefore he was unable to determine if it was in the best interests of the company to continue with the litigation He noted that Mr Spalla had not made any proposal by which the position of the company in relation to the adverse costs orders which are to be released under the settlement could be secured that is to say if authority was given to Mr Spalla to continue with the proceeding that the company would be no worse off than it would be in that respect under the settlement Rambaldi at 20 Similarly his Honour noted that he had no assurance beyond that stated by Mr Spalla as to how the companys ongoing costs are to be paid Rambaldi at 20117 Later that day but before 500 pm Mr Rambaldi procured the consent of his partners to the Deed118 Before turning to the parties submissions I note that Mr Borden properly conceded that he could not recollect the precise words used at the mediation or in premediation conferences and that in general his file notes are likely to be more reliable than his present recollection I accept this and further I accept that Mr Bordens handwritten notes which were made at the time of the mediation are even more reliable than his typed notes of the mediation202 On legal advice Mr Spalla did not make an application to take over the carriage of the primary proceeding for Irlmond Having sought his own independent legal advice Mr Rambaldi did apply to the Supreme Court Mr Spalla claims that the application to the Supreme Court was not made in good faith because Mr Rambaldi did not support it Mr Rambaldi explained that he did not support the orders sought by the application because he did not believe that Mr Spalla was an appropriate person to have conduct of the Irlmond claim in the primary proceeding He explained that in his view Mr Spalla was too emotionally involved with the litigation and might not be able to bring sufficient objectivity to the commercial decisions associated with managing litigation on behalf of a company in liquidation This does not show that Mr Rambaldi brought the application in bad faith As liquidator of Irlmond Mr Rambaldi was required to advise the Court of his position in relation to the application Although he did not support the application by bringing it he gave Mr Spalla the opportunity to seek an order giving him authority to conduct the litigation As Hansen J explain in Rambaldi at 18  D oubtless out of some thought for the other interests involved Mr Rambaldi has brought this application which may be thought to have been designed to draw Mr Spalla to seek authority to conduct the litigation under the guise of the originating process As I have said Mr Spalla takes the opportunity to seek that authority He wishes to be able to conduct the litigation and as discussed with counsel I could make such an order under s5111b of the Act if in my view it was otherwise appropriate to do so  Similarly I do not find that the application was brought in bad faith I find that it was filed in a good faith attempt to seek the guidance of the Court and to allow Mr Spalla an opportunity to put his case to the Court Overall I find no reason to conclude that Mr Rambaldi acted in bad faith in the week before the Deed was ratified
06_1177.xml,c8,referred_to,Westpac Banking Corporation v Totterdell (1998) 29 ACSR 448,122 Mr Spalla relied on s 1321 of the Corporations Act 2001 Cth the Act  as a basis for his application That section allows a person aggrieved by any act  or decision of a liquidator to appeal to the Court in respect of the act or decision The Court can confirm reverse or modify the act or decision Citing Westpac Banking Corporation v Totterdell 1998 29 ACSR 448  Westpac v Totterdell   Mr Spalla submitted that he had standing to bring an appeal under this section as a creditor of Irlmond of which he was also the sole director Mr Spalla also maintained that he had standing as an applicant and the funder in the primary proceeding He also pointed out that he and his wife were the owners and controllers of Anstella which in turn held all the issued shares in Irlmond Mr Spalla identified the decision of Mr Rambaldi to execute the Deed of Settlement on 29 April 2005 and subsequently seek and obtain the ratification of the Deed by his partners on 6 May 2005 as the subject of the appeal123 Under r 1412 of the Federal Court Corporations Rules the Rules any appeal under s 1321 of an act omission or decision of a liquidator must be filed within 21 days after the date of the act omission or decision appealed against Mr Spalla argued that his appeal was not out of time because even though his initial notice of motion did not refer to s 1321 of the Act  this proceeding was initiated within 21 days of the execution of the Deed In the alternative Mr Spalla sought an extension of time to bring an appeal under s 1321 He argued that an extension of time was appropriate because his initial notice of motion put Mr Rambaldi and other interested parties on notice of the nature of Mr Spallas complaints against him124 Mr Spalla also sought to rely on s 536 and s 1324 of the Act  As I accept that s 1321 is an appropriate vehicle for Mr Spallas challenge to the Deed it is unnecessary to discuss these sections of the Act further169 In the context of this case two considerations must be borne steadily in mind First s 5451 of the Act provides that a liquidator is not liable to incur any expense in relation to the winding up of a company unless there is sufficient available property Secondly by way of reiteration the courts are generally loath to enter into the area where the professional liquidator has made a commercial decision which he considers benefits the stakeholders whom he represents at least unless something is pointed to which suggests that there are some vitiating factors which entered into the making of the decision see Star v Silvia No 1 1994 12 ACLC 600 at 604 per Young J Sanderson v Classic Car Insurances Pty Ltd 1986 4 ACLC 114 at 116 per Young J Northbourne at 440 Westpac v Totterdell at 453454 per Ipp J with whom Pidgeon and White JJ agreed and Cook v Northoak Holdings Pty Ltd 1997 25 ACSR 517

06_1177.xml,c13,referred_to,Watson v Foxman (2000) 49 NSWLR 315,145 Although Mr Rambaldi asked the Court to prefer his evidence to that of Mr Spalla in so far as their evidence conflicted he did not ask the Court to make a negative credibility finding with respect to Mr Spalla Rather Mr Rambaldi relied on the principles referred to by McLelland CJ in Watson v Foxman 2000 49 NSWLR 315 at 319   H uman memory of what was said in a conversation is fallible for a variety of reasons and ordinarily the degree of fallibility increases with the passage of time particularly where disputes or litigation intervene and the processes of memory are overlaid often subconsciously by perceptions or selfinterest as well as conscious consideration of what should have been said or could have been said All too often what is actually remembered is little more than an impression from which plausible details are then again often subconsciously constructed All this is a matter of ordinary human experience  Mr Rambaldi said that these considerations were especially apposite in this case where Mr Spalla has a very high degree of personal involvement in the proceedings Mr Rambaldi noted that Mr Spalla has been caught up in litigation including the failed criminal prosecution for many years now Mr Rambaldi submitted that these difficult circumstances have impacted on Mr Spallas ability to consider the issues and events relating to this case in a dispassionate manner According to Mr Rambaldi this has lead to Mr Spalla misremembering some conversations such as the meeting at the conclusion of the mediation146 Mr Rambaldi submitted that as Mr Spalla alleged bad faith the Court is not being asked to decide whether Mr Rambaldi achieved the best settlement possible Mr Rambaldi sought to distinguish bad faith from negligence With bad faith he submitted the enquiry is directed to the actual state of mind of the decisionmaker against whom bad faith is alleged He argued that there is no such thing as constructive bad faith
06_1177.xml,c14,referred_to,Briginshaw v Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34 ; (1938) 60 CLR 336,147 Mr Rambaldi argued that bad faith is a serious allegation and that the Court must reach a comfortable satisfaction that the case is made out in accordance with the Briginshaw test see Briginshaw v Briginshaw 1938 HCA 34  1938 60 CLR 336  Briginshaw  at 361362 per Dixon J He submitted that as there is no precise definition of bad faith whether the case is made out will depend on the particular facts Mr Rambaldi contested that there were any grounds in this case for concluding that he had acted in bad faith Mr Spalla had failed so Mr Rambaldi said to adduce evidence to satisfy the Court on the balance of probabilities that in entering into the irrevocable offer Mr Rambaldi was actuated by bad faith148 Further counsel for Mr Rambaldi contended that Mr Rambaldi at all times acted in good faith Counsel asked for a positive finding that Mr Rambaldi was acting in good faith when he entered into the offer and recommended to his partners that it should be given effect A key element of Mr Rambaldis submissions was his claim that a liquidator who is not funded or is without indemnity is not expected to continue a proceeding Accordingly Mr Rambaldi could not have been expected to continue his involvement in the primary proceeding beyond 6 May 2005 Mr Rambaldi noted that Mr Borden who was the lawyer of Mr Rambaldi and Mr Spalla jointly had said that Mr Rambaldi could not be expected to continue the proceedings without an indemnity and would be entitled to accept a walkaway offer in those circumstances149 Mr Rambaldi argued that once he was informed on 29 April 2005 that his indemnity was to be withdrawn he knew that he would not be able to continue with the litigation after 6 May 2005 and he behaved reasonably to protect the interests of creditors in those circumstances He said that he procured an offer at the mediation that would stay open for seven days thereby providing an opportunity for options for continuing the litigation to be explored He claimed that he procured his partners consent to the Deed only after no reasonable way to continue the litigation was found He said that his conduct was consistent with the LFA Mr Spalla was utterly wrong to characterize what he did to preserve Mr Spallas position for seven days as a facade166 Mr Spalla has attempted to satisfy this standard of review by showing that Mr Rambaldi acted in bad faith in executing the Deed This is a serious allegation involving the imputation of moral turpitude The standard of proof to be applied is proof on the preponderance of probability with due regard to the seriousness of the particular issue being determined As Dixon J said in Briginshaw at 361362   W hen the law requires the proof of any fact the tribunal must feel an actual persuasion of its occurrence or existence before it can be found It cannot be found as a result of a mere mechanical comparison of probabilities independently of any belief in its reality  Except upon criminal issues to be proved by the prosecution it is enough that the affirmative of an allegation is made out to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal But reasonable satisfaction is not a state of mind that is attained or established independently of the nature or consequence of the fact or facts to be proved The seriousness of an allegation made the inherent unlikelihood of an occurrence of a given description or the gravity of the consequences flowing from a particular finding are considerations which must affect the answer to the question whether the issue has been proved to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal In such matters reasonable satisfaction should not be produced by inexact proofs indefinite testimony or indirect inferences  An allegation of bad faith is a serious claim affecting reputation and the Court should have regard to this when considering the evidence167 Section 1811 of the Act relevantly provides that an officer of a corporation a term that includes a liquidator s 9  must exercise powers and discharge duties in good faith in the best interests of the corporation and for a proper purpose Whether there has been bad faith will depend on the particular circumstances of the case

Giles J in Harrison v Schipp 2002 NSWCA 213  2002 54 NSWLR 738 at 22    approach taken to estimate costs must be logical fair and reasonable The power should only be exercised when the Court considers that it can do so fairly between the parties and that includes sufficient confidence in arriving at an appropriate sum on the materials available  See also Nine Films  Television Pty Ltd v Ninox Television Ltd 2006 FCA 1046The affidavits filed on behalf of Wrigley are directed to matters relevant to that passage from Harrison  They are those of Ian Stanley Pascarl a partner of Wrigleys solicitors and John Andrew Balmer a JB Legal Costing Pty Ltd costs consultant retained by WrigleyMr Pascarl instances aspects of the Mahlab assessment of profit costs and disbursements that he considers excessive and unreasonable He deposes   a detailed bill of costs and disbursements is drawn and served Wrigley will not be in an informed position to properly and fairly challenge those items The Borham affidavit does not provide any detailed breakdown of each item and the cost charged for each item by patent attorney Griffith Hack which charged a total of 220000 to Cadbury of which 170000 is now claimed against Wrigley Wrigley is entitled to be provided with that information and to vigorously test the need for and reasonableness of those chargesMr Balmer challenges aspects of Ms Youngs affidavit I take just three out of some fifteen of those aspects he challenges Ms Youngs allowance for scientific research and time spent collating documents and a loading for care skill and attention included in her cost assessment and says Wrigley is unable to review these allowances without the benefit of a detailed bill and should not be denied the right to taxation in order to establish and analyse the amounts hidden in the assessment he says Wrigley needs to be able to question the terms of Cadburys retainer of Griffith Hack and the nature of the patent attorney support provided and to rigorously question whether work done and fees charged represent necessary partyparty costs and he claims there is no basis upon which to assume that taxed professional costs may differ by 10 to 15 from the costs calculated in Mahlabs assessment and says it is for that reason that Cadbury requires a detailed bill in order to decide whether a taxation of Cadburys costs should be pursued Mr Balmer also takes issue with an aspect of Ms Borhams affidavit dealing with the retainer of Griffith HackThe Wrigley deponents claims and contentions are advanced in support of the view that there should be a taxation of Cadburys costs I must however bear in mind that of its nature specification of a gross sum is not the result of a process of taxation or assessment of costs Harrison at 22 Rather a broader brush must be applied than would be appropriate on taxation The present relevance of the Wrigley claims and contentions is that their existence unresolved has brought me to the clear view that I should not exercise the power to order a lump sum under Order 62 rule 4c because I am not satisfied that I can do so fairly between the parties and with sufficient confidence that I would be arriving at an appropriate sum on a logical and reasonable basis rather than selecting figures at random on the basis of an arbitrary preference for one experts view over anothers See Sony Entertainment at 199In all but one of the cases collected in the appendix to Cadburys written submissions the judge who fixed a lump sum was the trial judge who having heard the evidence and watched the proceeding unfold was in a much better position than I am to reach informed conclusions about the costs issues that are now in dispute In the Harrison case Giles JA as a member of the Court of Appeal had sat on an appeal in the matter and on one later proceeding that had been removed to the Court of Appeal in which the costs order made on the appeal was challenged His Honour was deputed by the Court of Appeal to hear a lump sum application that followed upon that Courts costs order Thus his Honour had a similar advantage to that enjoyed by the trial judge in the other cases referred to in the appendixCadbury submitted that the following considerations pointed in favour of the award of a lump sum the delay and expense involved in a taxation Cadburys assessments were prepared by an experienced costs consultant those assessments have been reduced by Ms Young as appears in her affidavit Ms Youngs methodology has not been criticised and if the matter were to proceed to taxation the costs of Ms Youngs assessments would be thrown away I accept the first three considerations but think the remaining two are overstated In any event I have taken all those matters into account in exercising my discretion They have not persuaded me to depart from the view I have expressed at 9The appropriate course in this case is for there to be a taxation Accordingly in the exercise of my discretion I decline to specify a lump sum pursuant to order 62 rule 4c The motion is dismissed with costs  I certify that the preceding twelve 12 numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons

Australia on a passport and student visa issued to his brother He applied for a protection visa under s 36 of the Migration Act 1958 Cth claiming that he was a refugee to whom Australia owed protection obligations under the Refugees Convention The application for a protection visa was refused by a delegate of the Minister The delegates decision was affirmed by the Refugee Review Tribunal The appellant later applied to the Minister under s 417 of the Act seeking a more favourable decision The Minister declined to exercise his powers under that section The appellant then became a member of the group represented by the plaintiffs in Muin v Refugee Review Tribunal 2002 HCA 30  2002 190 ALR 601 When judgment in that case was handed down in favour of the plaintiffs directions were given to enable the appellant to challenge the tribunals decision based on the reasoning of the High Court This he did in an application to the High Court for the issue of constitutional writs The application was remitted to the Federal Court and in due course was transferred to the Federal Magistrates Court where it was dismissed on its merits M1014 of 2003 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs  Anor 2005 FMCA 1652 The appellant now appeals that decisionThe basis upon which the appellant sought a protection visa was that Sri Lankan authorities suspect him of being a supporter of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam LTTE The appellant says that he fears being persecuted as a dissident if he returns to Sri Lanka The appellant claimed that he was tortured and imprisoned by Sri Lankan authorities following the discovery by police of weapons stored at the house in which he lived The weapons belonged to the LTTE The appellant claimed that these weapons were stored against his wishes by his brother and a TamilHindu friendIn its reasons the tribunal found the appellants claims that he was implicated in LTTE gunsmuggling that he was threatened by the LTTE or its agents that he was detained and mistreated by government security forces and that his brothers have been harassed on his account to be contrived Amongst other things the tribunal did not accept that LTTE operatives would entrust a Tamilspeaking Muslim with information about weapons In support of this finding the tribunal referred to the radical political divide between Tamilspeaking Muslims and the LTTEThe appellant applied for a writ of certiorari to quash the decision of the tribunal on the basis that the decision was affected by jurisdictional error The appellants complaint related to the procedures that were adopted by the tribunal in dealing with his application As in Muin  the appellant contended that certain documents containing country information that were referred to in part B of the delegates reasons for decision and which are said to be favourable to the appellants case were not provided to the tribunal The appellant alleged that as a result of correspondence he received from the tribunal to effect that the tribunal would ask the Department for and would look at all of the material relating to the appellants case he was mislead into believing that the tribunal had considered the part B documents and as a result he had been denied the opportunity to put this information before the tribunal Specifically the appellant said that had he known that the tribunal had not looked at this material especially the parts that would have helped his case he would have tried to make sure that the tribunal was aware of that material The appellant claimed that this failure to accord natural justice constitutes jurisdictional error and constitutional writs should issueIn his reasons the Federal Magistrate made four findings which were fatal to the appellants case First the Federal Magistrate concluded that the credibility findings against the applicant clearly stand alone in relation to his application They are not dependent upon whether or not the tribunal did or did not have in its possession the part B documents Second the Federal Magistrate was satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the tribunal did in fact have the part B documents before it Third the Federal Magistrate found that the appellant had failed to identify with sufficient clarity favourable material within the part B documents which he may have drawn to the tribunals attention Fourth the Federal Magistrate found that the appellant had not identified with any degree of certainty the manner in which he was mislead into believing that the tribunal had received and considered all of the part B documents As a result the Federal Magistrate dismissed the applicationThe question before this court is whether these findings were reasonably open to the Federal Magistrate Moreover if it was reasonably open to the Federal Magistrate to find as he did that the tribunal had the part B documents the appellants other grounds of appeal cannot succeedThe second basis upon which the appellant says the court should infer that the part B documents were not provided to the tribunal is the assertion that at the time of the appellants application to the tribunal there was a practice of the Secretary not to forward country information documents referred to in part B of the delegates reason for refusal As evidence of this practice the appellant sought to rely on the agreed statement of facts in Muin in which it was agreed that the Department did not include copies of the part B documents in the file concerning the plaintiffs that was dispatched to the tribunal The respondents do not make the same concession in this proceedingThis submission fails to take into account s 4351 of the Migration Act 1958 Cth That section provides that  a member of the Refugee Review Tribunal has in the performance of his or her duties as a member the same protection and immunity as a member of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal  This is the same protection and immunity as a Justice of the High Court Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 Cth s 60 This immunity which includes immunity from suit and compulsion to give evidence will prevent any adverse inference being drawn from a failure by a member of the tribunal to give evidence Muin v Refugee Review Tribunal Lie v Refugee Review Tribunal 2002 HCA 30  2002 190 ALR 601 paras 25 118 196199 The

06_1197.xml,c2,followed,Smith v The New South Wales Bar Association [1992] HCA 36 ; (1992) 176 CLR 256,Today is the first occasion on which I have had the benefit of representation of the respondent by counsel Until now effectively the case has proceeded with the respondent acting for himself The question of whether the Court should allow a limited reopening of the kind sought by the respondent has been discussed in a number of authorities In Smith v New South Wales Bar Association 1992 HCA 36  1992 176 CLR 256 at 265 Brennan Dawson Toohey and Gaudron JJ dealt with the question where as here judgment has been given I have made a finding of guilt on charge 2 but no orders have been enteredTheir Honours pointed out that the power of the court to set aside or vary such a judgment reflected in the analogue of O 35 r 71 was discretionary and existed up until the entry of judgment Their Honours said that it was a power that was exercised having regard to the public interest in maintaining the finality of litigation and that if reasons for judgment had been given the power was only exercised if there was some matter calling for review There may be their Honours pointed out more or less reluctance to exercise the power depending on whether there is an avenue of appeal Their Honours approved the statement that where there had been judgment in a case but the order had not been entered the power would not ordinarily be exercised to permit a general reopening However they made clear that that was a general statement only and once the matter had been reopened the nature and extent of the review had to depend upon the error or omission which led to the step being takenIn this case the error that is posited is that there was a factor overlooked by me in a construction of the order that might give rise to a reasonable doubt as to whether there had been a breach of it as I found I am of the opinion that in the circumstances of the proceedings the respondent has shown that there is a matter calling for review  Smith v New South Wales Bar Association 1992 176 CLR at 265 and Texas Company Australasia Limited v The Federal Commissioner of Taxation 1940 HCA 9  1940 63 CLR 382 at 457 per Starke J Accordingly in my view it is appropriate for me to consider the argument now raised by the respondent for the purposes of reconsidering my finding particularly as the respondent has sought to limit the basis of the review notwithstanding that he maintains a position of wishing to challenge the factual findings that I have made in the event that an appeal is taken
06_1197.xml,c3,applied,The Shell Co of Australia Limited v Esso Standard Oil (Australia Limited) [1961] HCA 75 ; (1963) 109 CLR 407,The respondent submits that when one has regard to the fact that the concept employed by the parties in their consent orders eschewed the broader concept of deceptive similarity as explained in The Shell Co of Australia Limited v Esso Standard Oil Australia Limited 1961 HCA 75  1963 109 CLR 407 it is at least open to raise a reasonable doubt as to whether what the respondent did as previously found by me in Natural Floor Covering Centre Pty Ltd v Monamy No 3 2006 FCA 602 at 12  was in fact a use that was the same or substantially identical with either of the registered marks The respondent does not accept that that finding was one which should have been arrived at on the facts but has left such rights as he may have to deal with that matter to be the subject of an appeal rather than seeking leave to reopen generallyThe respondent referred to the decision of Windeyer J in the Shell Co of Australia Limited v Esso Standard Oil Australia Limited 1961 109 CLR at 414415 where his Honour considered the concept of substantial identity within the meaning of the then Trademarks Act 1955 Cth and the decided cases on those words both here and in England in contradistinction to the other concept used in the legislation of deceptive similarity He explained that the task was to compare side by side the similarities and differences noted and the importance of those assessed having regard to the essential features of the registered mark and the total impression of resemblance or dissimilarity that emerges from that comparison He said that the judgment ought to be by eye alone for the purposes of determining substantial identity but noted that in an animated depiction where matters do not stand still fleeting glimpses of substantial identity were not enough although the position may be different with regard to deceptive similarity Since order 1 does not refer to the latter concept I need not deal with itGiven that these are proceedings which are criminal in nature in which the liberty of the subject is in issue it seems to me that I should err on the side of caution in construing order 1 Having now had the benefit of the argument put by the respondent I am of opinion that the words substantially identical as used in that order could be construed as denoting the concept in s 120 of the Trademarks Act 1995 Cth and as expounded in judicial decisions and that it is a reasonable construction of order 1 to read it in the way submitted by the respondent today That is so even though this is not necessarily the only construction that one would make That is to say the parties were identifying a limited legal concept as defining the extent of the protection that the order was seeking to give to the applicants two trademarks and they accepted that the particular depiction included as part of order 1 was an infringement of them While that is not for the reasons I have given in my earlier judgements the construction which I would place on the words I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt having now reflected upon the new argument put by the respondent through his counsel today that that is the only way one would read the consent orders in light of the heads of agreement which the respondent signed on 12 December 2005
06_1199.xml,c0,referred_to,Natural Floor Covering Centre Pty Ltd v Monamy (No 1) [2006] FCA 518,In these proceedings I found the applicant has satisfied me beyond reasonable doubt that the respondent was guilty on four charges of contempt in my judgment in Natural Floor Covering Centre Pty Ltd v Monamy No 1 2006 FCA 518 Today I have heard evidence from the respondent both on affidavit and in the witness box relating to the circumstances in which the contempts occurred and his current attitude in relation to the subject matter of those chargesThe applicant accepts that the respondent is now complying with the orders made by Wilcox J on 15 December 2005 and as I understand he has complied since at least I gave judgment on 9 May 2006 Although the applicant has filed an affidavit of Ms Than on 16 May 2006 which refers to a Mr Dennis Henry Monamy owning some property the respondent is Dennis Alfred Monamy and no suggestion was made when the respondent was being crossexamined that he was the owner of any propertyIn his evidence the respondent has deposed to commencing work in around 1990 as a contractor with the applicant installing floor coverings on a regular basis That relationship ended in around 1995 when he was unable to agree on further terms with the applicant He said he began trading under the business name Simply Natural Floorcoverings in around 1995 and created a web site for that purpose During the middle of 2005 the applicant and the respondent began a series of communications that ultimately led to the litigation and mediation in this court resulting in the orders made by Wilcox J on 15 December 2005The question then arises as to what fine I ought impose on each of the counts that I have found proved and for which I have convicted the respondent Charge 6 involved the use of the business name Simply Natural Floorcoverings with floorcoverings as one word on the web site for a period that commenced at least on 19 January 2006 and continued at least to 2 March 2006 as I found in Natural Floor Covering Centre Pty Ltd v Monamy No 1 2006 FCA 518 at 37 and 38I am of opinion that that was conduct which was quite clearly against both the spirit of the heads of agreement and the terms of the consent orders While I cannot take account of the heads of agreement in imposing penalty I am entitled to have regard to the fact that the respondent had urged that the orders were ones that he did not believe he needed to obey within any particular time The fact is that by 2 March 2006 he had applied to and succeeded in changing his business name to separate the word floorcoverings into two separate words It was plain in my opinion that that should have been done a long time before at least no later than when he was served with a properly endorsed set of orders on 19 January 2006 I do not think that this contempt has been satisfactorily explainedIt is appropriate that the court in addition to requiring a payment of costs should impose a penalty by way of a fine In all the circumstances I will impose a fine of 1500 for that breachCharge 11 involved the use of the HTML meta tag which I described in Natural Floor Covering Centre Pty Ltd v Monamy No 1 2006 FCA 518 at 41  47  That conduct was engaged in between at least 1 March 2006 as I found 2006 FCA 518 at 47 and at least no later than 24 April 2006 which is the date Ms Than refers to in par 5 of her affidavit of 15 May 2006 as the date on which the disclaimer was noted by her to appearThe period to which I have regard in imposing the fine in respect of charge 11 should I think reflect most prominently the use of the meta tag in the period between 1 March 2006 and the date of my finding of guilt on 12 April 2006 which is a period of almost six weeksIn my opinion this breach was quite flagrant as I described in Natural Floor Covering Centre Pty Ltd v Monamy No1 2006 FCA 518 It was a deliberate attempt to evade the very clear order requiring an active communication by the respondent of the dissociation of his business from the applicants The use of the meta tag was calculated to avoid giving effect at all to the order It was an attempt to disguise the very thing the order required be revealed namely the dissociation of the businessesI do not accept any explanation that the respondent has sought to give of that behaviour In the witnessbox today he asserted that he had put the meta tag there knowing as he said that it would not be visible to the ordinary viewer of the webpage but that it might be seen in some web browsers The reason he gave for putting the disclaimer in a meta tag was that he thought that that was above the fold referred to in the order For the reasons that I gave in Natural Floor Covering Centre Pty Ltd v Monamy No 1 2006 FCA 518  the use of the words above the fold makes no difference to the proper construction of the orders or the flagrancy of the evasion which the use of the meta tag involvedIn my opinion that behaviour was quite contumacious and deliberate as well as being clever in both senses of that word I think I should mark the courts disapprobation of that conduct by imposing a fine of 2500In reaching the view which I have expressed at this stage tentatively as to the appropriate fines to be imposed I have had regard to the nature and circumstances of each offence as I have outlined already I have also had regard to the matters referred to although I may not necessarily be required to do so in s 16A of the Crimes Act 1914 Cth in relation to sentence In particular each of the offences is related to the others and forms part of an ongoing course of conduct which ultimately came to an end with the recognition that the respondent has now given that his conduct was wrong and in breach of the orders

information discovery see generally Hooper v Kirella 1999 FCA 1584  1999 96 FCR 1 I am empowered by our Rules to order identity discovery where i an applicant having made reasonable inquiries is unable to ascertain the description of a person sufficiently for the purpose of commencing a proceeding in this Court against that person and ii it appears that some other person has has had or is likely to have knowledge of facts or possession of any document tending to assist in ascertaining who that person is4 Information discovery in contrast is discovery against the very person against whom relief may be sought It is tightly circumscribed in the requirements to be met before discovery may be ordered These are that   a there is reasonable cause to believe that the applicant has or may have the right to obtain relief in the Court from a person whose description has been ascertained   b after making all reasonable inquiries the applicant has not sufficient information to enable a decision to be made whether to commence a proceeding in the Court to obtain that relief and   c there is reasonable cause to believe that that person has or is likely to have or has had or is likely to have had possession of any document relating to the question whether the applicant has the right to obtain the relief and that inspection of the document by the applicant would assist in making the decision5 Common to both species of discovery is a prospective proceeding which may be commenced in this Court Inherent in this possibility are the requirements that the proceeding will be a within federal jurisdiction and b in respect of a cause of action known to law which is not purely speculative in character and which is not devoid of prospects There is no difficulty in this matter in relation to the former of these requirements some at least of the prospective causes of action being said to arise under Commonwealth legislation see Judiciary Act 1903  s 39B1Ac It is the latter requirement which requires the identification of a possible cause of action in this case a legal wrong done to the applicants that is problematic6 It is unnecessary for me to refer in detail to the growing body of case law on preliminary discovery It is sufficient for present purposes to refer to the following The O 15A r 3 power to order identity discovery is not to be used in favour of a person who intends to commence merely speculative proceedings A material factor in the exercise of the Courts discretion is the prospect of the applicant succeeding in proceedings against the person wished to be sued Hooper v Kirella at 33 Information discovery under O 15A r 6 is significantly limited by the conditions imposed in subpars a b and c of that rule Subpar a requires that there be reasonable cause to believe that the applicant has or may have the right to obtain relief in the Court While the threshold test under this subrule may be set at quite a low level see Gull Petroleum WA Ltd v Tah Land Pty Ltd 2001 FCA 1531 at 59  the test for determining whether the applicant has a reasonable cause to have the requisite belief is an objective one see Hooper v Kirella at 39 Though it is not necessary to demonstrate a prima facie case it is not enough merely to assert that there is or is the mere possibility of a case against the prospective respondent Hooper v Kirella at 39 Importantly as Hely J observed in St George Bank Ltd v Rabo Australia Ltd 2004 211 ALR 147 at 26  d belief requires more than mere assertion and more than suspicion or conjecture Belief is an inclination of the mind towards assenting to rather than rejecting a proposition Thus it is not sufficient to point to a mere possibility The evidence must incline the mind towards the matter or fact in question If there is no reasonable cause to believe that one of the necessary elements of a potential cause of action exists that would dispose of the application insofar as it is based on that

06_12.xml,c21,considered,Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police [1987] UKHL 12 ; [1989] AC 53,87 I referred above to the absence of reference to the context in which the duty allegedly owed Scott Rush is said to arise for this reason In Tame v New South Wales 2002 HCA 35  2002 211 CLR 317 Tame at 231 Gummow and Kirby JJ observed in dicta  It is unlikely that an investigating police officer owes a duty of care to a person whose conduct is under investigation Such a duty would appear to be inconsistent with the police officers duty ultimately based in the statutory framework and anterior common law by which the relevant police service is established and maintained fully to investigate the conduct in question  Their Honours cited in support of this view the decisions inter alia of Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police 1987 UKHL 12  1989 AC 53 Hill at 6365 and Sullivan v Moody 2001 HCA 59  2001 207 CLR 562 at 60  Similar views were expressed in Tame by McHugh J at 125126 Hayne J at 298 and by Callinan J at 33533692 It equally is well recognised that to impose common law duties of care on police officers to a particular member or members of the public in addition to their duty to the general public can on occasion be inconsistent with the proper and effective discharge of their public responsibilities cf Sullivan v Moody  at 62 whether those responsibilities arise under a statute such as the AFP Act or at common law and to be impermissible for that reason As the observations of Gummow and Hayne JJ in Tame illustrate this inconsistency is often revealed where in a setting in which injury is foreseeable if care is not taken in the conduct of a police investigation a suspect a victim or a third party injured by acts or omissions of the police seeks to raise a claim in negligence against the police Hill  above Thompson v Vincent 2005 NSWCA 219 at 152  154  Batchelor v State of Tasmania 2005 TASSC 11  Cran v State of New South Wales

Municipality or Other Governmental Unit for Failure to Provide Police Protection from Crime 90 ALR 5 th 273 at SS4  57 Am Jur 2d Municipal County School and State Tort Liability SSSS407418 such attempts have been unsuccessful94 The progenitor of this principle was the decision of the House of Lords in Hill  After concluding that in the circumstances of that case the ordinary principles of negligence would not admit of a duty of care to a victim of crime Lord Keith went on to indicate at 63 that there was another reason why an action for damages in negligence should not be against the police in the circumstances of that case and that was public policy His Lordship then observed  The general sense of public duty which motivates police forces is unlikely to be appreciably reinforced by the imposition of such liability so far as concerns their function in the investigation and suppression of crime From time to time they make mistakes in the exercise of that function but it is not to be doubted that they apply their best endeavours to the performance of it In some instances the imposition of liability may lead to the exercise of a function being carried on in a detrimentally defensive frame of mind The possibility of this happening in relation to the investigative operations of the police cannot be excluded Further it would be reasonable to expect that if potential liability were to be imposed it would be not uncommon for actions to be raised against police forces on the ground that they had failed to catch some criminal as soon as they might have done with the result that he went on to commit further crimes While some such actions might involve allegations of a simple and straightforward type of failure for example that a police officer negligently tripped and fell while pursuing a burglar others would be likely to enter deeply into the general nature of a police investigation as indeed the present action would seek to do The manner of conduct of such an investigation must necessarily involve a variety of decisions to be made on matters of policy and discretion for example as to which particular line of inquiry is most advantageously to be pursued and what is the most advantageous way to deploy the available resources Many such decisions would not be regarded by the courts as appropriate to be called in question yet elaborate investigation of the facts might be necessary to ascertain whether or not this was so A great deal of police time trouble and expense might be expected to have to be put into the preparation of the defence to the action and the attendance of witnesses at the trial The result would be a significant diversion of police manpower and attention from their most important function that of the suppression of crime Closed investigations would require to be reopened and retraversed not with the object of bringing any criminal to justice but to ascertain whether or not they had been competently conducted I therefore consider that Glidewell LJ in his judgment in the Court of Appeal 1988 QB 60 76 in the present case was right to take the view that the police were immune from an action of this kind on grounds similar to those which in Rondel v Worsley 1967 UKHL 5  1969 1 AC 191 were held to render a barrister immune from actions for negligence in his conduct of proceedings in court101 It is in my view unnecessary in this matter to express a concluded view on whether as in England a special though not unqualified immunity rule applies to police activities in the investigation and suppression of crime Costellos case at 563 or whether the duty of care question is to be answered by applying to police those principles now generally applied to public authorities in the discharge of their statutory and if relevant common law functions see Graham Barclay Oysters Pty Ltd v Ryan  I am of this view because both binding and persuasive authority lead inevitably to the conclusion that this application must fail However I would respectfully suggest that more recent English authority demonstrating reluctance to endorse the full breadth of what Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire  has been thought to lay down on the immunity of police cf Brooks v Commissioner of Police  at 3 6 and 28 and the difficulty in providing criteria to mark out exceptions to that immunity see eg Costello  Cowan v The Chief Constable for Avon  Somerset Constabulary 2001 EWCA Civ 1699  tell in favour of avoiding any special rule applicable to police while still acknowledging that the police function can have distinctive characteristics and purposes which in many settings may exclude the concurrent operation of a duty of care at common law cf Doe  72 DLR 4 th at 584586104 As I earlier noted the judgment of Gummow and Kirby JJ in Tame relied on Sullivan at 60 above when expressing the view that it was unlikely that an investigating police officer would owe a duty of care to a person whose conduct was under investigation Sullivan equally was invoked by Hayne J and Callinan J to the same end in Tame  In its apparent endorsement of Hill at 57 in the above quotation Sullivan along with

06_12.xml,c22,applied,Sullivan v Moody [2001] HCA 59 ; (2001) 207 CLR 562,87 I referred above to the absence of reference to the context in which the duty allegedly owed Scott Rush is said to arise for this reason In Tame v New South Wales 2002 HCA 35  2002 211 CLR 317 Tame at 231 Gummow and Kirby JJ observed in dicta  It is unlikely that an investigating police officer owes a duty of care to a person whose conduct is under investigation Such a duty would appear to be inconsistent with the police officers duty ultimately based in the statutory framework and anterior common law by which the relevant police service is established and maintained fully to investigate the conduct in question  Their Honours cited in support of this view the decisions inter alia of Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police 1987 UKHL 12  1989 AC 53 Hill at 6365 and Sullivan v Moody 2001 HCA 59  2001 207 CLR 562 at 60  Similar views were expressed in Tame by McHugh J at 125126 Hayne J at 298 and by Callinan J at 33533692 It equally is well recognised that to impose common law duties of care on police officers to a particular member or members of the public in addition to their duty to the general public can on occasion be inconsistent with the proper and effective discharge of their public responsibilities cf Sullivan v Moody  at 62 whether those responsibilities arise under a statute such as the AFP Act or at common law and to be impermissible for that reason As the observations of Gummow and Hayne JJ in Tame illustrate this inconsistency is often revealed where in a setting in which injury is foreseeable if care is not taken in the conduct of a police investigation a suspect a victim or a third party injured by acts or omissions of the police seeks to raise a claim in negligence against the police Hill  above Thompson v Vincent 2005 NSWCA 219 at 152  154  Batchelor v State of Tasmania 2005 TASSC 11  Cran v State of New South Wales 2004 NSWCA 92  2004 62 NSWLR 95

v State of New South Wales  at 33 ff but cf contra Zalewski v Turcarolo 1995 2 VR 562 a decision which predated Sullivan v Moody 102 Sullivan v Moody did not involve an allegation of negligence against police officers Its concern was with whether medical practitioners and social workers who had examined children for evidence of sexual abuse by their fathers in the setting of a statutory regime containing provisions for the protection of children including mandatory reporting to a government department of reasonable suspicion of child abuse owed a duty of care to protect such fathers in the conduct of their examinations investigations and reporting It was held unanimously by the High Court that they did not The plaintiff fathers had alleged that as a result of negligent examination diagnosis and reporting they had suffered shock distress psychiatric injury and consequential personal and financial loss Unsurprisingly given the opinions expressed by the Court Sullivan v Moody has been influential in this country in later decisions and judicial commentary on police liability for negligence in the conduct of investigations103 In rejecting the duty of care argued for in Sullivan v Moody the Court observed   55  A duty of the kind alleged should not be found if that duty would not be compatible with other duties which the respondents owed   56 How may a duty of the kind for which the appellants contend rationally be related to the functions powers and responsibilities of the various persons and authorities who are alleged to owe that duty A similar problem has arisen in other cases The response to the problem in those cases although not determinative is instructive   57 In Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire  the House of Lords held that police officers did not owe a duty to individual members of the public who might suffer injury through their careless failure to apprehend a dangerous criminal Lord Keith of Kinkel pointed out that the conduct of a police investigation involves a variety of decisions on matters of policy and discretion including decisions as to priorities in the deployment of resources To subject those decisions to a common law duty of care and to the kind of judicial scrutiny involved in an action in tort was inappropriate      60 The circumstance that a defendant owes a duty of care to a third party or is subject to statutory obligations which constrain the manner in which powers or discretions may be exercised does not of itself rule out the possibility that a duty of care is owed to a plaintiff People may be subject to a number of duties at least provided they are not irreconcilable A medical practitioner who examines and reports upon the condition of an individual might owe a duty of care to more than one person But if a suggested duty of care would give rise to inconsistent obligations that would ordinarily be a reason for denying that the duty exists Similarly when public authorities or their officers are charged with the responsibility of conducting investigations or exercising powers in the public interest or in the interests of a specified class of persons the law would not ordinarily subject them to a duty to have regard to the interests of another class of persons where that would impose upon them conflicting claims or obligations       62 The statutory scheme that formed the background to the activities of the present respondents was relevantly a scheme for the protection of children It required the respondents to treat the interests of the children as paramount Their professional or statutory responsibilities involved investigating and reporting upon allegations that the children had suffered and were under threat of serious harm It would be inconsistent with the proper and effective discharge of those responsibilities that they should be subjected to a legal duty breach of which would sound in damages to take care to protect persons who were suspected of being the sources of that harm The duty for which the appellants contend cannot be reconciled satisfactorily either with the nature of the functions being exercised by the respondents or with their statutory obligation to treat the interests of the children as paramount As to the former the functions of examination and reporting require for their effective discharge an investigation into the facts without apprehension as to possible adverse consequences for people in the position of the appellants or legal liability to such persons As to the latter the interests of the children and those suspected of causing their harm are diverse and irreconcilable That they are irreconcilable is evident when regard is had to the case in which examination of a child alleged to be a victim of abuse does not allow the examiner to form a definite opinion about whether the child has been abused only a suspicion that it may have happened The interests of the child in such a case would favour reporting that the suspicion of abuse has not been dispelled the interests of a person suspected of the abuse would be to the opposite effect emphasis added104 As I earlier noted the judgment of Gummow and Kirby JJ in Tame relied on Sullivan at 60 above when expressing the view that it was unlikely that an investigating police officer would owe a duty of care to a person whose conduct was under investigation Sullivan equally was invoked by Hayne J and Callinan J to the same end in Tame  In its apparent endorsement of Hill at 57 in the above quotation Sullivan along with Hill and DOrtaEkenaike v Victoria Legal Aid above have been treated by the New South Wales Court of Appeal as recognising that there is an area in which it has been held that the public law duties of police are not consonant with recognition of a private law duty of care in favour of a particular member of the public Thompson v Vincent at 153154 Again as I have already noted Tame and its debt to Sullivan and Hill were relied upon again by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Cran v State of New South Wales in privileging the greater public interested accorded unimpeded police investigation over the interest of a person suffering foreseeable harm as a result of an allegedly careless omission in the conduct of an investigation114 There is a short answer to the alleged duty Even if it be the case that AFP officers said they would act or had acted in a particular way towards Scott Rush at the airport and failed to do so neither their representations and their failure to act nor the circumstances of the MyerPatching conversations could give rise to a duty such as is alleged The proposed duty would be inconsistent with the duty owed by the AFP to the public at large in the conduct of its investigations into the Bali drug trafficking operation cf Sullivan v Moody at 60115 I have already indicated that the AFP officers concerned did not act in contravention of the AFP Act in deciding to and in making the 8 and 12 April 2005 communications to the INP They were acting in performance of their functions under the AFP Act and consonantly with ministerial directions The communications made had a proper and rational purpose in the furtherance of that police investigation The proposed duty would only qualify and impede the conduct of the investigation embarked upon by the AFP It would elevate the interests of Scott Rush over the public interest that the AFP was serving under its legislation to the extent that the two collided as it did in the making of the request to the INP116 If as the other applicants seem to suggest albeit faintly a like duty was owed them its obvious effect would have been to compromise the investigation itself in an important respect No assistance of the type sought could have been asked of the INP notwithstanding that the investigation involved transnational criminal activity and that the assistance in fact sought as I have noted was for a proper purpose in furtherance of the AFPs statutory functions117 In the cases of Scott Rush and of the other applicants the duty contended for cannot be reconciled with the nature and purpose of the functions being exercised by the AFP officers concerned the discretions conferred on them in virtue of the task they were involved in and the policy directive they were apparently implementing cf Sullivan v Moody at 62 Accordingly to adopt Santow JAs observations in Cran v State of New South Wales at 63 the greater public interest accorded unimpeded investigation by the AFP precludes in this case any duty of care owed to Scott Rush or to the other applicants Such is the current law in this country and the policy informing it that the interests of the applicants were subordinated to the public interests served by the AFP in their conduct of the investigation in question
06_12.xml,c23,considered,Brooks v Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis [2005] UKHL 24 ; [2005] 1 WLR 1495,89 Before I express my own views on this I should emphasise the following Bearing in mind that this is an application for preliminary discovery where information about the possible commission of a tort is being sought exceptional caution must be exercised before reaching a conclusion that whatever the information that might be disclosed as a result of an order for information discovery that information could make no difference for the reason that the duty contended for could not even arguably be imposed on AFP members when conducting the drug trafficking investigation in question cf the observations of Lord Bingham in Brooks v Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis 2005 UKHL 24  2005 1 WLR 1495 at 4 90 As noted earlier there are conflicting versions as to the substance of the conversations between Robert Myers on behalf of Lee Rush and Mr Patching of the AFP The alleged duty of care is premised upon acceptance of Myers version of what transpired For present purposes and dealing with the matter on the basis most favourable to the applicants I am prepared to assume the correctness of that version for the purposes of this application Nonetheless I am satisfied from what is already known about the circumstances surrounding Myers communications with Patching that the negligence claim as it has been framed would in any event be unarguable irrespective of any further information relevant to it that might conceivably be forthcoming if an order for information discovery were to be made Accordingly I am satisfied for the purposes of O 15A r 3 that no such proceeding for negligence could properly be brought in this Court and for the purposes of O 15A r 6 there is no reasonable cause to believe that Scott Rush may have a right to obtain relief on the basis proposed98 What is noticeable in the case law of common law countries illustrated above including that of England is that it is accepted both that positive dangerous behaviour by police can still attract a duty of care and that particularly in cases of omissions to act the police may nonetheless have or have assumed such a particular responsibility to take care of a person as to give rise to a special relationship with that person which attracts a duty of care to him or her see eg Brooks v Commissioner of Police at 22 and 29 Costello v Chief Constable of the Northumbria Police esp per May LJ in US jurisdictions the special relationship exception is well recognised in a range of otherwise negligence exempt areas of police activity see eg Eaton above at SS4  see also 57 Am Jur 2d above at SS410 ff What equally is notable is the varying significance given to the particular operational context in which the relationship giving rise to a duty of care is said to exist Hence the ready imposition of a duty of care to persons in police custody Hall v Whatmore  above and the corresponding reluctance to impose such a duty in the context of the conduct of a criminal investigation DOrta Ekenaike v Victoria Legal Aid at 101102 see also Cran v State of New South Wales  above or in preventing a breach of the peace Thompson v Vincent  above101 It is in my view unnecessary in this matter to express a concluded view on whether as in England a special though not unqualified immunity rule applies to police activities in the investigation and suppression of crime Costellos case at 563 or whether the duty of care question is to be answered by applying to police those principles now generally applied to public authorities in the discharge of their statutory and if relevant common law functions see Graham Barclay Oysters Pty Ltd v Ryan  I am of this view because both binding and persuasive authority lead inevitably to the conclusion that this application must fail However I would respectfully suggest that more recent English authority demonstrating reluctance to endorse the full breadth of what Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire  has been thought to lay down on the immunity of police cf Brooks v Commissioner of Police  at 3 6 and 28 and the difficulty in providing criteria to mark out exceptions to that immunity see eg Costello  Cowan v The Chief Constable for Avon  Somerset Constabulary 2001 EWCA Civ 1699  tell in favour of avoiding any special rule applicable to police while still acknowledging that the police function can have distinctive characteristics and purposes which in many settings may exclude the concurrent operation of a duty of care at common law cf Doe  72 DLR 4 th at 584586

exclusionary principle based on public policy accurately reflects the law in this country see Thompson v Vincent at 153154 or whether the principle does no more than represent the usual or predictable but not invariable consequence of the evaluation of whether the relationship between the police and an individual in a given instance imports a duty of care in the context of a police investigation cf Graham Barclay Oysters Pty Ltd v Ryan 2002 HCA 54  2002 211 CLR 540 at 149  Before so doing it is important to emphasise that police officers are not as such and in all circumstances immune from the law of negligence for acts or omissions in the course of official duty that occasion foreseeable harm The contrary is clearly the case as a large case law in common law jurisdictions including England attests Zalewski v Turcarolo  Costello v Chief Constable of the Northumbria Police 1999 1 All ER 550 see also Grubb ed The Law of Tort  The Police 1673 ff 2002 Linden Canadian Tort Law  286 625 7 th

England is that it is accepted both that positive dangerous behaviour by police can still attract a duty of care and that particularly in cases of omissions to act the police may nonetheless have or have assumed such a particular responsibility to take care of a person as to give rise to a special relationship with that person which attracts a duty of care to him or her see eg Brooks v

public authorities in the discharge of their statutory and if relevant common law functions see Graham Barclay Oysters Pty Ltd v Ryan  I am of this view because both binding and persuasive authority lead inevitably to the conclusion that this application must fail However I would respectfully suggest that more recent English authority demonstrating reluctance to endorse the full breadth of what Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire  has been thought to lay down on the immunity of police cf Brooks v Commissioner of Police  at 3 6 and 28 and the difficulty in providing criteria to mark out exceptions to that immunity see eg Costello  Cowan v The Chief Constable for Avon  Somerset Constabulary 2001 EWCA Civ 1699  tell in favour of avoiding any special rule applicable to police while still acknowledging that the police function can have distinctive characteristics and purposes which in many settings may exclude the concurrent operation of a duty of care at common law cf Doe  72 DLR 4 th at 584586107 First it needs to be emphasised that the AFP was performing a statutorily mandated function ie the provision of legal services in relation to laws of the Commonwealth The particular subject of the inquiry transnational crime and illicit drug trafficking  fell within areas of special emphasis in the direction given to the Commissioner by the Minister on 31 August 2004 As the 8 April 2004 letter to the INP reveals the AFP was already possessed of a considerable body of information relating to past and likely prospective moves of inter alia the applicants That letter indicated the AFPs purpose in making its request was that the AFP would like to identify the source of the drugs and the organisers other than CHAN in Australia In other words there was a rational and proper police purpose for the making of the request If there was to be a concurrent common law duty of care this was the statutory and operational setting with which it had to be compatible cf Graham Barclay Oysters Pty Ltd v Ryan at 147108 Secondly there was no contact between the AFP and any of the applicants at all let alone contact that could lead Scott Rush or any of the others to reasonably believe or expect that the AFP had assumed some tutelary responsibility for him or her on which each could rely109 The MyerPatching communications were directed to Lee Rush not to the applicants generally or to Scott Rush in particular I assume for the purposes of this application that those communications led Lee Rush reasonably to believe that AFP officers would and did speak to Scott Rush at Sydney airport and because of this he did not go to Bali to save his son from committing any offence I equally assume that Scott Rush was to have been the beneficiary of the police action Lee Rush believed had occurred and that the police failure to speak to him before his departure to Bali denied him the opportunity to abandon his participation in the trafficking operation given its predictable consequence However it is not the failure to warn as such that underpins the alleged negligence of the AFP officers Rather it appears to be said that having regard a to the alleged provision of information by or on behalf of Lee Rush to Patching about the apprehended criminal activity by Scott Rush and b the request for assistance in relation to Scott Rushs departure from Sydney and the alleged representation that it had been given the AFPs failure to act against this background may have authored a duty not to use the information in a way that put Scott Rush at risk of exposure to the death penalty in Indonesia Hence it is said there is reasonable cause to believe that he may have a right to obtain relief from the relevant AFP officers in a negligence action in this Court

law of common law countries illustrated above including that of England is that it is accepted both that positive dangerous behaviour by police can still attract a duty of care and that particularly in cases of omissions to act the police may nonetheless have or have assumed such a particular responsibility to take care of a person as to give rise to a special relationship with that person which attracts a duty of care to him or her see eg Brooks v Commissioner of Police at 22 and 29 Costello v Chief Constable of the Northumbria Police esp per May LJ in US jurisdictions the special relationship exception is well recognised in a range of otherwise negligence exempt areas of police activity see eg Eaton above at SS4  see also 57 Am Jur 2d above at SS410 ff What equally is notable is the varying significance given to the particular operational context in which the relationship giving rise to a duty of care is said to exist Hence the ready imposition of a duty of care to persons in police custody Hall v Whatmore  above and the corresponding reluctance to impose such a duty in the context of the conduct of a criminal investigation DOrta Ekenaike v Victoria Legal Aid at 101102

06_1215.xml,c2,referred_to,Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Z-Tek Computer Pty Ltd (1997) 78 FCR 197,Fourthly there must be a relevant nexus between the injunction or undertaking and the alleged or established contravening conduct It is not the case that an injunction or undertaking can only be framed in terms of restraining a repetition of contravening or alleged contravening conduct Foster  As far as future conduct is concerned an injunction or undertaking may be in wider terms The question of what is a relevant nexus between the alleged or established conduct and the proposed order or undertaking has been discussed in the context of orders or undertakings requiring a compliance or educational programme to be implemented Of course there is no denying the desirability of an extensive compliance or educational programme but that is a different issue from the question of the Courts power to order such a programme or to accept an undertaking to implement such a programme In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v ZTek Computer Pty Ltd 1997 78 FCR 197  ZTek  Merkel J considered the scope of an appropriate order implementing a trade practices compliance programme His Honour said at 203   summary in determining whether an injunction under s 80 is appropriate there are at least three limitations on the Courts power   the power is confined by reference to the scope and purpose of the TPA and in particular s 80 It is within the scope and purpose of s 80 to grant injunctive relief which is designed to prevent a repetition of the conduct for which the relief is sought   there is a contextual limitation within s 80 itself As the jurisdiction to grant an injunction is enlivened by an alleged or actual contravention of a provision of Pt IV  IVA or V of the TPA there must be a sufficient nexus or relationship between the contravention and the injunction granted It is that nexus or relationship that enables determination by the Court of whether the injunction sought is appropriate   there is the constitutional limitation which requires that the injunction granted be related to the case or controversy the subject of the proceeding  A little later his Honour said at 205   trade practices compliance program agreed to relates to the TPA generally rather than to the specific provisions in Pt V which are alleged to have been contravened by ZTek It was contended by counsel for the ACCC that the program was appropriate because it arose as a result of a breach of the TPA In my view the contention is based on an unwarranted and excessively broad view of s 80 The jurisdiction to make orders under s 80 only arises as a result of advertising and representations by ZTek which are alleged to have contravened ss 52  53 e and 53C of the TPA As the order is sought under s 801AA I do not have to be satisfied that the conduct contravened the particular provisions of the TPA Nevertheless I must determine whether the orders are appropriate   the reasons discussed earlier any order requiring the implementation of a trade practices compliance program should be one which has a sufficient nexus or relationship to the conduct alleged to constitute a breach of a particular provision of the TPA Given that the orders are sought by consent I am prepared to take a broad view of the conduct which may fairly be described as misleading or deceptive advertising and the making of representations in contravention of ss 52  53 e and 53C of the TPA The compliance program which the Court may order should be no wider than one which is designed to prevent repetition of that conduct   orders sought require a compliance program in respect of all parts of the TPA which will include for example Pt IV and other parts which have no connection whatsoever with the alleged conduct giving rise to the case or controversy in the Court In my view it is not appropriate to make orders which require a compliance program which relates to conduct other than the alleged contravening conduct as characterised by the Court  The comments of Merkel J at 203 were referred to in Foster  The Full Court did not say anything to suggest that they did not agree with his observationsThe conclusions of Mr Johnson are generally favourable to Auspine in terms of the effectiveness of its trade practices compliance programme However in the course of his report Mr Johnson makes a number of recommendations and those recommendations are the subject of the undertaking They are as follows   Auspine may wish to consider the development of short targeted information sheets that could be made available to staff as relevant eg restrictive trade practices issues consumer protections issues These would be more likely to be read and referred to by staff than the longer manuals and policies that are currently available   It may also benefit Auspine to engage in a process eg regular emails notices or short regular training sessions for staff which are designed to raise staff awareness of their everyday trade practices obligations      That Auspine in consultation with its current Company Secretary and Legal Counsel review whether any additional support or resources are required to effectively perform the role of Compliance Manager      Auspine may wish to consider strengthening its program by arranging regular reminder sessions for staff and business managers on how trade practices issues can be identified and referred For example as resources permit Auspines Legal Counsel may be able to provide regular brief presentations at various Business Unit meetings within Auspine on current trade practices related matters that may have an impact on Auspine This will also allow that person to touch base with staff and keep trade practices compliance current in the minds of staff in between the planned biannual training sessions      If training is to be rolled out to Auspine staff every two years steps should be taken during that time to ensure that staff remain aware of current trade practices issues and any changes to the legislation Auspine may wish to consider short regular trade practices information sessions that could be conducted for targeted staff on topics of relevance to Auspines operations This will assist Auspine by reducing the time between training sessions ensuring more targeted training is conducted while minimising disruption to everyday duties of staff and general business operations of Auspine      Auspine may wish to strengthen the Program by taking steps to remind staff on a regular basis of the trade practices risks that are relevant to their everyday operations This could be done by way of targeted brief information sessions for groups of staff or regular presentations by Auspines Legal Counsel at Business Unit or staff meetings     It seems to me that there are two difficulties with this undertaking The first difficulty is that the compliance programme to which the undertaking relates goes beyond the provisions of ss 45 and 45A of the Act and indeed the provisions in Part IV of the Act  ZTek  REIWA  This difficulty can be overcome by linking the recommendations to the provisions in Part IV of the ActThe second difficulty relates to the nature of the recommendations Is it within power or appropriate to impose nothing more than an obligation to consider doing something Counsel for the Commission said that it was likening the obligation to that placed on the holder of a power to appoint property of a testator or settlor to third parties I am prepared to accept that in the circumstances of this case it is within power and appropriate to impose an obligation or accept an undertaking requiring Auspine to consider doing something The undertaking is proffered as part of a commercial settlement Auspine is a large organisation which has a detailed trade practices compliance programme and an obvious interest in improving the same The difficulty with some of the recommendations set out above is that they do not even place an obligation on Auspine to consider taking a particular course of action I would not accept an undertaking in such terms This particular problem can be overcome by making the obligation to consider mandatoryThe fourth undertaking is proffered by Bone Timber and JAG Timber and is in the following terms   undertaking given to the Court by each of the Third and Fifth Respondents that it will implement a Trade Practices Corporate Compliance Program in accordance with the terms of Annexure 1 heretoThere are difficulties with this undertaking which arise from the terms of the programme referred to in the undertaking To understand these difficulties it is necessary to set out in full the terms of the programme   The Respondent shall appoint a Trade Practices Compliance Officer to be responsible for the implementation of the Program The Program will be implemented within two calendar months of this Undertaking   The Respondent shall ensure that The Trade Practices Compliance Officer receives training in trade practices law     The Respondent will ensure that the Program including processes which the Respondent intends to implement in order to comply with the Program are approved by an independent external consultant with appropriate knowledge of trade practices law prior to implementation     The Respondent shall require the Trade Practices Compliance Officer to review     The contents of any media and material containing training or operational information for its staff to ensure that it adequately addresses and informs about   restrictive trade practices proscribed by Part IV of the Trade Practices 1974 sic the TPA including in particular price fixing and anticompetitive collusion in the context of contracts arrangements and understandings and   412 consequences of breaching the TPA   Training and operating procedures for its staff involved in any way in quoting or providing takeoffs for supply of timber or in organizing attending or otherwise participating in any meetings with competitors concerning matters relevant to the trading activities of such persons to ensure that its staff are adequately informed and advised about   restrictive trade practices proscribed by the TPA including in particular price fixing and anticompetitive collusion in the context of contracts arrangements and understandings   not contravening the provisions of Part IV of the TPA and   423 consequences of breaching the TPA   The Respondent shall require the Trade Practices Compliance Officer to maintain a documentary record of the compliance review of     The Respondents training and operational media and material   The Respondents training and operating procedures for staff involved in any way quoting or providing takeoffs for supply of timber or in organizing attending or otherwise participating in any meetings with competitors concerning matters relevant to the trading activities of such persons   Such documentary record will include   i a description of the media and materials   ii a copy of the materials   written advice that the relevant media and materials have been reviewed and cleared by the Trade Practices Compliance Officer including the date on which they were reviewed   written advice of any improvements that could be made to reduce the risks of possible contraventions of the TPA that were identified by the Trade Practices Compliance Officer and the action taken to implement those improvements   The Respondent shall ensure that the documentary records of the compliance reviews are available to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to be reviewed from time to time Such records are to be available from one week after the date of review for a period of three years after that date Such records are to be provided to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission within five working days of a written request for those records The Respondent shall ensure that an independent external consultant with expertise in trade practices law conducts training on the Program including in relation to price fixing and anticompetitive collusion in contravention of Section 45 of the TPA to the Respondents staff on six occasions during the three year period following the making of this Undertaking The first of these training programs is to be completed within three calendar months of this Undertaking and the remaining five on a six monthly basis thereafter The Respondent shall retain an independent external consultant with expertise in trade practices law to provide the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission with three annual reports being at 12 months 24 months and 36 months following the making of this Undertaking on the Respondents compliance with the Program and these reports shall be provided to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission within   13 months of this Undertaking   25 months of this Undertaking and   37 months of this Undertaking respectively   The annual reports shall include the review and reporting of   The Respondents adherence to the Program   The implementation of the Program its consistency with Australian Standard AS3806 and the achievement of its objectives over the preceding twelve months and   Any recommended changes to the Program that may be necessary to ensure achievement of its objectivesThe principal problem is that the major aspects of the programme are not defined The formulation of the programme is left to the respondent and the external consultant clause 3 The suggestion is that it is up to an independent external consultant to determine if whatever programme is formulated is appropriate and is implemented from time to time clauses 8 and 9 As I have said I do not see a difficulty with a requirement that an independent external consultant review the question of compliance with a programme providing the major aspects of the programme are defined and providing the question of whether there has been a breach of the programme is not made to turn solely on the consultants opinion A further difficulty is that there is

06_1215.xml,c3,referred_to,BMW Australia Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (2004) 207 ALR 452,Fifthly a question which has arisen in the cases and which arises in this case is the Courts power to make an order or accept an undertaking requiring an external audit of a compliance programme or alternatively the appropriateness of so doing It seems that such an order may not be made under s 86C BMW Australia Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission 2004 207 ALR 452 Gray Goldberg and Weinberg JJ at 468 51 It is important to have a clear understanding of what is meant by an external audit of a compliance programme In my opinion an order or undertaking which leaves the definition of the major obligations undertaken by a respondent to a third party or which makes the question of whether there has been a breach turn on the assessment or opinion of a third party is beyond power or at the very least inappropriate A court should not grant an injunction leaving the scope of the injunction to be determined by a third party and should not accept an undertaking to similar effect Such an injunction or undertaking would not be in clear and unambiguous terms and it would involve an impermissible delegation of the Courts power to formulate the terms of the order and to determine the question of breach None of this is to say that an order or undertaking might not include a provision for an external audit providing the major obligations are defined and it is clear that the question of breach is for the court to determine having regard to the facts and the terms of the order or undertakingI turn now to consider the particular undertakings proffered in this caseThe first undertaking which is proffered by the corporate respondents is in the following terms   of Auspine Limited Geo J Bone  Sons Pty Ltd and JAG Timber Products Pty Ltd for a period of 5 years whether by its directors servants or agents or otherwise howsoever undertakes to the Court to refrain from   making or attempting to make any contract or arrangement or arriving at or attempting to arrive at any understanding with a competitor or competitors containing a provision or provisions that   any or all of them would no longer provide estimating services without charge but would pass on to the customer any charges incurred at cost   any or all of them would procure or attempt to procure or induce other competitors to make an arrangement or arrangements alternatively to arrive at an understanding or understandings containing a provision to the same effect but including such other competitors or some of them as the provision set out in subparagraph i above or   iii any or all of them would charge customers for estimating services at a particular price or particular prices or in accordance with or by reference to a particular mechanism process or procedure by which the price or prices of estimating services to be charged by all or any of them would be fixed or controlled   giving effect to any such contract arrangement or understanding with a competitor or competitors containing a provision or provisions that   any or all of them would no longer provide estimating services without charge but would pass on to the customer any charges incurred at cost   any or all of them would procure or attempt to procure or induce other competitors to make an arrangement or arrangements alternatively to arrive at an understanding or understandings containing a provision to the same effect but including such other competitors or some of them as the provision set out in subparagraph i above or   any or all of them would charge customers for estimating services at a particular price or particular prices or in accordance with or by reference to a particular mechanism process or procedure by which the price or prices of estimating services to be charged by all or any of them would be fixed or controlled

FCAFC 224 at 288 per French and Lindgren JJ This does not mean that the addressee is a technician or person with only practical and nonacademic qualifications In fields such as chemistry the addressee can be a person or group with high level qualifications and a capacity for original research Aktiebolaget Hassle v Alphapharm Pty Ltd 2002 HCA 59  2002 212 CLR 411 at 30  The test formulated by the majority in Alphapharm at 5354 is whether the addressee would directly be led as a matter of course to pursue one avenue in the expectation that it may well produce the claimed result Their Honours referred to the approach taken by Graham J in Olin Mathieson Chemical Corporation v Biorex Laboraties Ltd 1970 RPC 157 at 187188 His Honour framed the question in terms of whether a notional research group at the relevant date in all the circumstances which include a knowledge of all the relevant prior art and of the facts of the nature and success of a chemical would be led directly as a matter of course to try a particular substitution in the expectation that it might well produce a useful alternative to or better drug than the existing drug or a body useful for any other purpose152 In approaching the question of obviousness it is necessary to assess the inventiveness of the invention and not simply to examine each integer in isolation In Alphapharm  the majority said at 58  The tracing of a course of action which was complex and detailed as well as laborious with a good deal of trial and error with dead ends and the retracing of steps is not the taking of routine steps to which the hypothetical formulator was taken as a matter of course This observation is pertinent to the present case Mere verification or discovery is not an invention An invention may be made by a brilliant sudden insight or act or by a slow and laborious approach see In re Farbenindustrie AGs Patents 1930 47 RPC 289 at 322 per Maugham J Obviousness is not determined by asking whether a particular avenue of research is worth a try179 In addition Professor Reynolds gave evidence of the lengthy research and experimental process and the detailed steps taken by him over 18 years to arrive at the invention taking account of different stages and streams of research in relation to the formation of complexes at various pH values to increase the yield the extensive trial and error involved and the consideration of documents teaching away from the invention These elements are important considerations in relation to the question of obviousness see Alphapharm at 53180 Dr Mackinlay was asked by NSI to describe by way of a hypothetical research project the HRP how he would have gone about developing a chemical entity that would take advantage of the interaction between casein and calcium phosphate and have the maximum amount of calcium phosphate bound This was based on the assumption that it was part of the common general knowledge that calcium phosphate binds to casein181 The University levelled several criticisms at the HRP First the University submitted that Dr Mackinlays opinion was affected by hindsight Secondly it contended that the HRP assumed part of the inventive process Thirdly it was submitted that Dr Mackinlay proceeded on the wrong test of obviousness by having regard to whether straightforward or routine steps could be taken to make the invention184 In relation to the second issue it can be seen from the parameters of the HRP that it assumes part of the inventive process namely the recognition of a desirable outcome The desirable outcome was an advanced treatment for dental caries using calcium phosphate and casein The University submits that because of this assumption the HRP lacked a context in the sense that the end goal was a given The University also refers to the approach outlined by the High Court in Alphapharm at 53 In this case the High Court stated that the question is whether the person or group would be led directly as a matter of course to try the claimed invention in the expectation that it might well produce a useful result This indicates the importance of context in providing a useful result The research is then evaluated in the light of a given purpose result or direction Dr McKinnon said that he would want to know about the purpose or context of a HRP before embarking on it He said that without this information he would not have embarked on the HRP engaged in by Dr Mackinlay because it lacked direction and definition185 In relation to the third issue the University submits that Dr Mackinlay proceeded on the basis that the making of adjustments in relation to pH temperature ionisation and concentration were routine and that this disclosed an erroneous approach to the question of obviousness The correct and different test that was accepted in Alphapharm at 53 is whether a person would be led directly as a matter of course to try the claimed invention in the expectation that it may well produce a useful or better alternative to the product that existed previously186 Finally it is submitted by the University that the outcome of the HRP does not correspond with the terms of the invention because it does not refer to the form of the amorphous calcium phosphate and omits an important integer of Claim 7187 In my view there is cogency in these submissions by the University and I accept them I do not give any significant weight to the HRP on the question of obviousness

06_122.xml,c2,followed,Burazin v Blacktown City Guardian Pty Ltd (1996) 142 ALR 144,5 ACI submitted that if the Court held that it had the power to make an order for compensation which took into account noneconomic loss it should be guided by the principles for the award of nonpecuniary loss which have been developed in unfair dismissal jurisprudence It referred to the judgment of the Full Court of Industrial Relations Court of Australia in Burazin v Blacktown City Guardian Pty Ltd 1996 142 ALR 144 at 156 where the Court said  There is an element of distress in every termination To ensure compensation is confined within reasonable limits restraint is required But in this case there were unusual exacerbating circumstances that make it appropriate to include in the compensation an allowance for the distress unnecessarily caused to Ms Burazin These circumstances include Ms Burazin having to suffer the humiliating experience of being escorted from Blacktowns premises by the police Having regard to these circumstances the compensation assessed by the trial judge should be increased by the sum of 2000 to 50006 ACI observed that the only evidence of noneconomic loss before the Court was that contained in Mr Williams affidavit of 14 October 2005 which referred to the financial stress occasioned by his termination It said that there was no evidence about any unusual exacerbating circumstances associated with the manner of his termination7 The Union submitted that the passage in Burazin relied upon by ACI did not articulate a benchmark test but only stated why on the facts before the Court compensation for distress was appropriate The Union contended that there is no warrant for limiting compensation for noneconomic loss to situations which are unusual and exacerbating8 The Union said that Mr Williams suffered an injury in two ways First it said that he was not permitted to leave his work premises in a dignified way but was pressed to leave the factory quickly with security summoned Second it said that Mr Williams sudden unemployment caused him stress and tension as a result of his family losing the income of its sole breadwinner9 The Union conceded that Mr Williams gave no evidence about the impact of ACIs treatment on him on the day of his termination It further accepts that some restraint is called for but contends that in the circumstances some compensatory order should be made It also submitted that some compensation should be given to Mr Williams as a result of his affidavit evidence that his termination caused him shock and emotional strain and placed his relationship with his wife under pressure11 I make no order as to compensation in the circumstances of this case To do otherwise would not be acting with restraint In my view Burazin establishes that something more is required for compensation for noneconomic loss than the usual element of distress which accompanies most terminations Whilst unusual and exacerbating circumstances is not necessarily the yardstick there must be something attending a termination which justifies an order for noneconomic loss Such an order may have been made in this case had Mr Williams given evidence of the effect on him of his ejection from his workplace by security personnel Order  There be no order as to compensation I certify that the preceding eleven 11 numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Marshall AssociateDated 24 February 2006 Counsel for the Applicant Dr C Jessup QC with Mr S Moore   Solicitor for the Applicant CEPU   Counsel for the Respondent Mr F Parry SC with Mr C OGrady   Solicitor for the Respondent Clayton Utz   Completion of written submissions 7 February 2006   Date of Judgment 24 February 2006    AustLII Copyright Policy  Disclaimers  Privacy Policy  Feedback  URL httpwwwaustliieduauaucasescthFCA2006122html

COURT OF AUSTRALIA  NEW SOUTH WALES DISTRICT REGISTRY TAD 31 OF 2005  ON APPEAL FROM THE ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS TRIBUNAL CONSTITUTED BY ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR DAVIS  BETWEEN DAVID JOHN RHODES  Applicant AND AUSTRALIAN FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY  Respondent  JUDGE CONTI J DATE OF ORDER 8 SEPTEMBER 2006 WHERE MADE SYDNEY  THE COURT ORDERS THAT  The application for review by way of appeal from the decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal made on 27 July 2005 be dismissedIn reaching those conclusions it becomes perhaps unnecessary for me to consider in the circumstances postulated by Mr Rhodes the scope of operation of the general law relating to the formation and promulgation of Ministerial policy as a guide to the exercise of administrative discretion Nevertheless I would record in that context the principles restated by Brennan J as then President of the AAT in Re Drake and Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs No 2 1979 2 ALD 634 at 640 as follows   are powerful considerations in favour of a Minister adopting a guiding policy It can serve to focus attention on the purpose which the exercise of the discretion is calculated to achieve and thereby to assist the Minister and others to see more clearly in each case the desirability of exercising the power in one way or another Decisionmaking is facilitated by the guidance given by an adopted policy and the integrity of decisionmaking in particular cases is the better assured if decisions can be tested against such a policy can diminish the inconsistencies which might otherwise appear in a series of decisions and enhance the sense of satisfaction with the fairness and continuity of the administrative process   course a policy must be consistent with the statute It must allow the Minister to take into account the relevant circumstances it must not require him to take into account irrelevant circumstances and it must not serve a purpose foreign to the purpose for which the discretionary power was created A policy which contravenes these criteria would be inconsistent with the statuteReference may also be made in that regard to Minister for Immigration Local Government and Ethnic Affairs v Gray 1994 50 FCR 189 at 206 where French and Drummond JJ referring to Re Drake observed as follows   place of government policy in the Tribunals decisionmaking will depend upon the interests of good government and consistent decisionmaking on the one hand and the ideal of justice in the individual case on the other But its decision must be the result of an independent assessment of all the circumstances of the particular case and not the uncritical application of policyPurportedly by way of reply Mr Rhodes contended that AFMA did not point to any properly articulated statement as to what is said to be its limited entry policy in a form that the AAT or this Court can properly assess such a policy   as being lawful by reference to the structure and operation of the Management Act and   as being applicable to the circumstances of Mr Rhodes   I do not think that to be correct In any event upon that somewhat sweeping and unspecific footing Mr Rhodes contended that there is therefore no policy within the scope of Drake  and further that to the extent such a policy might be implied from various matters found in the evidence such a policy when properly construed does not treat Mr Rhodes as a new entrant in any relevant sense I have difficulty in distilling the implications of either contention The policy is articulated or reflected both explicitly and implicitly for instance in the provisions of sections 751j and 624 The objective circumstances were that Mr Rhodes did not tender payment of the management levy of 40000 at any material time his fishing permit relating to the period of time from 1 March 2001 to 31 December 2001 was suspended on 9 May 2001 and cancelled on 12 July 2001 After those events had occurred Mr Rhodes merely forwarded to AFMA a form of application for fishing permit and did so without any tender of payment of feesIt was next asserted by Mr Rhodes that nothing can be taken from the events prior to the OCS arrangements 1985 to 2001 in relation to boat and net numbers as affecting Mr Rhodes and that whatever policy may have been in place it was expressly overridden by the OCS transfer of jurisdiction from Tasmania to the Commonwealth The first limb of that assertion was not seemingly supported in relation to either boat numbers or fish net numbers and the second limb purportedly propounded a proposition without any apparent much less reasoned support It was then asserted by Mr Rhodes that OCS arrangements required the Commonwealth to treat Tasmanian fishermen on a fair and equitable basis with Commonwealth fishers and further that the same expressly permitted Tasmanian Shark Gill Net and Hook fishermen to apply for a Commonwealth fishing concession Those provisions originated in the Memorandum of Understanding of 17 November 2000 clause 12g thereof reading as follows   ensuring individual fishers in a fishery who come under the Commonwealths jurisdiction as a result of OCS arrangements are treated on a fair and equitable basis with all other fishers in the school shark and gummy shark fisheryHowever that opportunity for equal participation was not openended at least in the sense of accommodating prospective or aspirational entrants Thus clause 14 of the Memorandum of Understanding under the subheading Commonwealth School Shark and Gummy Shark Management required listed fishers within 60 days from notification to apply for a Commonwealth shark fishing concession  and clause 15 thereof recorded that AFMA has taken a decision in accordance with its legislative objectives that school shark and gummy shark will be managed by determining the total allowable catch of each species allocating the Commonwealth component of the TAC to individual Commonwealth fishing concession holders as individual quota and making this individual quota transferable Moreover clause 16 stipulated for the initial allocation mechanism to apportion the TAC of school shark and gummy shark sectors within the Southern Shark Fishery and for  the appropriate formulae for the allocation of Individual Transferable Quotas for school shark and gummy shark amongst Southern Shark Fishery permit holders within each of the sectors  pursuant to recommendation by an independent allocation advisory panel which was charged with the task of recommending a result which ensures that all operators in the fishery are treated on a fair and equitable basis in the allocation process  However so much did not declare or envisage contextually that the allocation process would remain open to newcomers if otherwise qualified to apply as licensed fishers  subsequent to the operation of the initial allocation mechanism

AND AUSTRALIAN FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY  Respondent  JUDGE CONTI J DATE OF ORDER 8 SEPTEMBER 2006 WHERE MADE SYDNEY  THE COURT ORDERS THAT  The application for review by way of appeal from the decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal made on 27 July 2005 be dismissedNevertheless so the submissions of Mr Rhodes continued the OCS Memorandum of Understanding contemplates the fishery will be managed by determination of total allowable catch for quota species allocation of that TAC quota to permit holders and making such quota transferable  Mr Rhodes referring generally again to clauses 14 to 16 of the Memorandum of Understanding of 17 November 2000 and to page 11 of the Southern Shark Fishery 2001 Management Arrangements of January 2001 appearing under the heading Is Quota Transferable That begs the issue as to restrictions imposed elsewhere in relation to the permit holders to be the subject of such allocations It was submitted further by Mr Rhodes in the present context that apart from the 2003 Management Plan and the OCS arrangements there was no evidence before the AAT of any promulgated policy of the Minister or AFMA to refuse applications for fishing permits in the SESS Fishery it was said by Mr Rhodes in that regard that  cases such as Re Green and Australian Fisheries Management Authority 2004 AATA 426  2004 81 ALD 194 are distinguishable To provide a brief key to an understanding of the ratio in Re Green I extract below the headnote which would at least not seem to lend support to Mr Rhodes contention in that regard   relevant AFMA policy did not have the status of Ministerial policy or policy adopted by a body such as the Australian Fisheries Council comprising the relevant Commonwealth and state ministers However the policy was settled and adopted by the AFMA board after consultation with key stakeholders and should be given great weight by the tribunal and should be applied unless it was unlawful or unless there were cogent reasons militating against its application in the circumstances of the particular caseIt was acknowledged by Mr Rhodes that when determining the quota to be allocated to individual fishing permits considerations of management by way of the TAC ie total allowable catch quota and environmental concerns invoking the precautionary principle may well be relevant and I was referred in that regard to AFMAs letter of 12 November 2003 to Mr Rhodes which concluded with AFMAs statement of an inability  to reinstate your fishing permit 26978  to which letter I have already referred in some detail However there additionally appeared in that letter the further statement that l imiting the number of operators in a fishery has been widely adopted through the world as a necessary first step in any management of fisheries resources  AFMA furthermore cited Technical Guidelines for responsible fisheries 4  being a United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisations 1997 publication which contained reference to the factor that  limited access is widely considered to be essential for efficient and responsible fisheries  In the same context AFMA further cited the 1992 Intergovernmental Agreement on the Environment  entered into by the Commonwealth State and Territory Governments in Australia where in par 351 the following appeared   there are threats of serious or irreversible environmental damage lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing measures to prevent environmental degradation It was in the context essentially of what I have summarised in the present segment of these reasons that Mr Rhodes contended boldly that it was inconsistent with the objectives of the Management Act the SESS Management Plan and the OCS arrangements to refuse Mr Rhodes application on the basis that he was at the time of the application not the holder of a current permit I have experienced considerable difficulty in distilling any such themes of assistance from those materials in favour of Mr Rhodes contentions propounded by counsel and which I have sought to summarise or reproduce in these reasons

DISTRICT REGISTRY TAD 31 OF 2005  ON APPEAL FROM THE ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS TRIBUNAL CONSTITUTED BY ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR DAVIS  BETWEEN DAVID JOHN RHODES  Applicant AND AUSTRALIAN FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY  Respondent  JUDGE CONTI J DATE OF ORDER 8 SEPTEMBER 2006 WHERE MADE SYDNEY  THE COURT ORDERS THAT  The application for review by way of appeal from the decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal made on 27 July 2005 be dismissedIt was in the context of those levy and charge collection provisions of the Management Act that Mr Rhodes further submitted that where the Act has expressly provided for the penalty to be imposed for failure to pay a levy it is an improper exercise of power by AFMA to seek to impose a further penalty on Mr Rhodes by refusing to issue him a new permit and further that had Parliament intended that cancellation of a permit be permanent it would have made specific provision to that effect It was further submitted by Mr Rhodes that the cost recovery argument also ignores the ability of AFMA under section 326 to impose conditions on the issue of a permit and further that if there are outstanding levies or other obligations the permit could be made conditional upon the applicant first discharging his outstanding levy obligations Whether a logical stopping place in terms of viable and convenient economic management may be articulated in support of that contention must be at least difficult to encapsulate It is a common feature of contractual remedies of cancellation of entire contractual rights on default of payment of a liquidated sum that the same crystallise ipso facto  and are exercisable subject to whatever formalities of notice may be stipulated by the governing contract or any statutory stipulation Treating the failure to pay levies as fatal to Mr Rhodes application was said by Mr Rhodes in any event to misconstrue the discretion vested in AFMA under s 32 of the Management Act that being described as not a matter of cost recovery but effecting in substance a forfeiture which in private law would give rise to relief for unconscionable conduct Qualification for relief of that kind would normally be at least formidable Mr Rhodes invoked the decision of the High Court in Legione v Hateley 1983 HCA 11  1983 152 CLR 406 but the analogy is hardly in kilter That well known High Court authority concerning relief against forfeiture related to a purchaser by instalments originally of vacant land in circumstances where the purchaser erected subsequently a home on the land at a time when the land had not been fully paid for and hence in circumstances where upon termination of the contract for default in payment of the purchase price for the vacant land the vendors will receive an illmerited windfall per Gibbs CJ and Murphy J at 429In my opinion the loss of the statutory privilege in the nature of the present fishing permit by reason of nonpayment of periodic levies geared to the continuance on foot of the permit would not constitute sufficient analogy with the principles of the general law concerning forfeiture of property or proprietary rights in circumstances where the statutory entity gains no proprietary or pecuniary advantage and is merely enabled or assisted to perform its statutory functions and obligations

Mr Rhodes fishing permit for reasons of socalled nonpayment of fees or levies it was acknowledged that in determining the scope of the obligation of natural justice the statutory framework is of crucial importance I was referred by Mr Rhodes to the High Court decision of Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation 1963 HCA 41  1963 113 CLR 475 where in the reasons for judgment of Kitto J at 5024 his Honour considered whether the Taxation Board of Review was  legally bound to conform to the principles of natural justice in dealing with a reference in a case under s 136  Kitto J made the prefatory observations that a legal obligation so to act arises in respect of many statutory powers there being  no words which are of universal application to every kind of inquiry and every kind of tribunal but what the law requires in the discharge of a quasijudicial function is judicial fairness  which is  not a label for any fixed body of rules and what is fair in a given situation depends upon the circumstances  The statutory context of the then Income Tax and Social Services Contribution Assessment Act 19361958 Cth which was of course in focus in Mobil Oil  is significantly removed from that of the Management Act Mr Rhodes sought support additionally for the operation in principle of the rules as to natural justice from the dictum of Brennan J in National Companies and Securities Commission v News Corporation Ltd 1984 HCA 29  1984 156 CLR 296 at 326 where his Honour observed as follows   the limits of a statutory function are ascertained the interests which are apt to be affected by the performance of the function can be identified Then it is possible for a court to say in the absence of express statutory provision what has to be done to be fair to those whose interests are apt to be affected by the performance of the function The terms of the statute which creates the function the nature of the function and the administrative framework in which the statute requires the function to be performed are material factors in determining what must be done to satisfy the requirements of natural justice  Those considerations render formidable the task of establishing the operation of the rules of natural justice in the present statutory context where the basis for prospective qualification would be the same for all applicants that being the holding of an existing shark permit conditional of course upon payment of the permit fee or levy

COURT OF AUSTRALIA  NEW SOUTH WALES DISTRICT REGISTRY TAD 31 OF 2005  ON APPEAL FROM THE ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS TRIBUNAL CONSTITUTED BY ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR DAVIS  BETWEEN DAVID JOHN RHODES  Applicant AND AUSTRALIAN FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY  Respondent  JUDGE CONTI J DATE OF ORDER 8 SEPTEMBER 2006 WHERE MADE SYDNEY  THE COURT ORDERS THAT  The application for review by way of appeal from the decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal made on 27 July 2005 be dismissedIt was next contended by Mr Rhodes that an important factor relevant to the scope of natural justice is the consequence of the decision In Gribbles Pathology Vic Pty Ltd v Cassidy 2002 FCA 859  2002 122 FCR 78 at 117 Weinberg J enunciated the following principle   is well established that the seriousness of a decision for an affected individual is one of the main considerations determining the application of procedural fairness Generally speaking the requirements of procedural fairness will be heightened in proportion to the gravity of the consequences involved  It was said in that context that if AFMA was right to refuse Mr Rhodes a new permit on no new permits or cost recovery grounds the consequence of cancellation of his permit would be his effective expulsion from the fishery that being described as a very serious consequence to Mr Rhodes Apart from the particular elements of the statutory scheme here relevantly required to be adjectivally observed there was here involved an absence of response on his part over an extended period of time involving what the Tribunal characterised in terms of inevitable consequences obvious to him  The reality of Mr Rhodes circumstances of default was such as to render attenuated his invocation of the scope of natural justice inherent in the submissionA further matter submitted by Mr Rhodes not to have been considered by the AAT but nevertheless said to have been relevant to the circumstances in which he found himself to be placed was that his long involvement in the industry and the potential effects on him of any decision to cancel the permit gave rise inherently to a legitimate expectation of procedural fairness The submission begged the question at least as to what was inherently unfair procedurally in the nature and extent of the steps taken and processes implemented by AFMA which merely conformed to the steps and processes required to be put in train in relation to any industry participant who was placed in the same vulnerable position as Mr RhodesA yet further factor said here to have prevailed in Mr Rhodes favour against any cancellation of his permit was a lack of urgency in relation to the making by AFMA of its cancellation decision It was submitted by Mr Rhodes that there was no good reason for AFMA to have made that decision in relation to the cancellation of the permit within a matter of weeks after the suspension It was further submitted that the Management Act expressly contemplated the indefinite suspension of a permit and there was no requirement even to consider cancellation after a suspension However it was plainly within AFMAs prerogative to determine whether it should exercise juridical powers and remedies which had crystallised in operation to the extent that it deceased to be appropriate in the contextual circumstancesMr Rhodes next submitted that he had been already prohibited from fishing prior to the cancellation of his permit yet interest on the unpaid levies would continue to accrue at a penal rate No benefit to AFMA was therefore obtainable from cancellation of the permit other than AFMAs view that it could thereupon terminate the need for socalled internal reconsideration and that such motivation on AFMAs part would have been improper in any event It was further submitted that this would have a very adverse effect on Mr Rhodes It was not however a condition to AFMAs lawful exercise of regulatory authority to endeavour to divine the particular implications of a permit cancellation personal or peculiar to a defaulting permit holder so long as the requirements of the stipulated procedure were observed In that regard the AAT found it sufficient in any event that AFMA had made attempts to communicate with Mr Rhodes prior to the cancellation such attempts consisting of AFMAs letters of 9 May 2001 and 25 May 2001 calling a telephone number listed on AFMA records and requesting on 5 June 2001 that the local police get in touch with Mr RhodesMr Rhodes submitted in any event that since the AAT did not find that he received any of that AFMA correspondence or had any actual notice of AFMAs intention to cancel the subject permit and further that the AAT expressly refused to make any finding that Mr Rhodes had deliberately avoided potential creditors or had received what was described as financial correspondence those factors should have rendered inapplicable any issue otherwise arising as to Mr Rhodes absence of response to AFMAs communications related to Mr Rhodes default Instead it was contended by Mr Rhodes that the AAT took the view that his ignorance of AFMAs intention to cancel his permit was unreasonable To the extent that that contention did have juridical significance which I am unable to accept in any event it is not possible to divine any basis for the extremity of the course which AFMA should have supposedly pursued in an endeavour to communicate relevantly with Mr Rhodes and to do so prior to exercising its legal rights and remedies

06_1228.xml,c0,applied,Fitch v Migration Review Tribunal [2004] FCA 1673,29 As emerged at the hearing on 7 June 2006 the appellants main argument in substance the only ground now pursued is that he satisfies items A and E of clause 1002214 of Schedule 2 of the Regulations and that the Tribunal and Federal Magistrate erred by failing to ask the necessary questions and ignored relevant material namely provisions of the Family Law Act 1975 Cth Family Law Act and the Child Support Assessment Act 1989 Cth Assessment Act The appellant relied on the decision of Dowsett J in Fitch v Migration Review Tribunal 2004 FCA 167330 The appellants argument is as follows In relation item A the appellant relied on s 61C and s 61D of the Family Law Act  Under s 61C1 of the Family Law Act  a parent has parental responsibility for a child to the extent that it is not displaced by a parenting order of the Court and under s 61C2  that legal position is not affected by changes in the nature of the parents relationship such as separation Section 61B explains what parental responsibility means Section 61D sets out the effect of a parenting order Since there was no evidence before the Tribunal of any court order affecting the appellants parental responsibility the Tribunal should have taken as given that it was intact and he had joint custody of his daughter31 The minute of 27 May 2006 was also said to be relevant to item A It was submitted that the Tribunal should have drawn the inference from the sponsors statement she was now living with the appellant that their young daughter would also be living with them On that basis the Tribunal should have concluded that not only did the appellant have parental responsibility but also that by living with her he was necessarily exercising a measure of day to day care for the daughters welfare and development He therefore satisfied item A40 The second decision is Fitch  In that case the Ministers delegate refused to grant the visa applicant a Subclass 801 visa a permanent spouse visa At the time of the decision whether to grant the visa an applicant must satisfy clause 8012211 of Sch 2 of the Regulations which requires that the applicant meets the requirements of one of clauses 2 2A 3 4 5 6 or 8 Clause 8012216cii is identical to clause 1002214cii The applicants relationship to the sponsor had ended In the Tribunal the applicant claimed that clause 6 was satisfied because he satisfied item 6ciiA and his sponsor satisfied item 6ciiE in relation to the son of their relationship There was evidence before the Tribunal in the form of a statutory declaration that the applicant and the sponsor had an informal agreement whereby the applicant saw his son on particular days and alternate weekends and contributed financially to his upkeep The Tribunal found that the visa criteria were not satisfied It found that there was no evidence before it of a Court order under the Family Law Act granting access joint custody or residence nor was their evidence that the applicant had an obligation under a child maintenance order under that Act or any other formal and accepted maintenance obligation see 7 of his Honours reasons41 In this Court the applicant submitted that the Tribunal had erred in its construction of items A and E in three respects The Minister conceded one ground namely that the Tribunal had construed the alternative criteria in items C D and E as referring to the visa applicant rather than the sponsoring spouse However the Minister contended that the application would have failed for other reasons The two other grounds urged by the applicant were 1 that informal arrangements under which an applicant has custody joint custody or access can satisfy item A and 2 the sponsoring spouse may have a formal maintenance obligation for the purpose of item E even in the absence of a court order or other formal arrangement42 Dowsett J concluded that both items A and E were satisfied In relation to item A his Honour found that the applicant had custody or joint custody His Honour considered the definition of custody in the Regulations and the definition of parental responsibility in s 61B of the Family Law Act  concluding that the two expressed the same core concept and neither purported to create new rights or obligations at 14 His Honour considered that the content of the term custody as used in the Regulations depended upon the Family Law Act as well as the general law and other statutes In that context his Honour found that parental responsibility and custody were not matters of strict legal rights but were more in the nature of parental obligations His Honour said at 24  It follows that the present applicant has parental responsibility for his child including either custody or joint custody of him I see no reason to conclude that the informal arrangements in place between him and his sponsoring spouse make any difference to the custody situation43 Having found that the applicant had custody or joint custody it was not necessary to address whether the applicant had access However his Honour noted that the term access not defined in the Regulations  was traditionally used to describe contact arrangements between a noncustodial parent and his or her child His Honour said at 25 that I see no reason to conclude that access arrangements must be pursuant to a court order if they are to satisfy item A44 In relation to the sponsoring spouse satisfying item E his Honour noted the common law responsibility of a parent to maintain a child which was recognised and enforced by statute referring specifically to s 286 of the Queensland Criminal Code and s 15 of the Maintenance Act 1965 Qld His Honour noted that at all relevant times the sponsoring spouse was under a statutory obligation to maintain her child and concluded that such obligation constituted a formal maintenance obligation52 Counsel for the appellant submitted that Fitch established that once a child is born in Australia of parents living in Australia one of whom in this case is an Australian citizen that the father and the mother stand in a statutory relationship to that child by virtue of the provisions of the Family Law Act  That statutory relationship obviates the need for a visa applicant to produce evidence of even make submissions in order to satisfy the requirement contained in clause 1002214cii It should also be noted that counsel for the appellant submitted that Dowsett Js reference to ss 61C and 66C of the Family Law Act was incorrect as s 3 of the Assessment Act would apply in relation to the child in Fitch as well as in the present case but nothing turns on that since the provisions are the same in substance53 Counsel for the Minister submitted that Fitch did not go so far as the appellant contended What Dowsett J concluded was that the level of formality required to satisfy the relevant criteria was not stringent but not that the statutory relationship between parent and child obviated the need for evidence and submissions As the Tribunal correctly stated there had been no evidence before it that the criteria in clause 1002214cii were met The Tribunal could not sensibly have accepted the minute as proof that the appellant had responsibility for the daughters day to day welfare and that there was a joint custody arrangement It could equally have been presumed from the minute that the appellant was failing to care for or support their daughter54 Counsel for the Minister also submitted that in any event Yazbec should be preferred to Fitch She submitted that following Yazbec  the Tribunal did not have before it evidence of a formal maintenance obligation and did not err by proceeding to make a decision under s 359A when such information was not forthcoming The main basis on which it was contended that Yazbec should be preferred was that Sundberg J took a more thorough and orthodox approach to statutory construction particularly in relation to the term formal maintenance obligation in item E Counsel contended that the approach of Dowsett J in Fitch gave no meaning to the term formal rendering it otiose and with no work to do This was contrary to a proper approach to statutory construction It was submitted that Dowsett J did not undertake a proper assessment of the term formal maintenance obligation in reaching his conclusion and in particular that he did not consider the difference between a maintenance obligation and a formal maintenance obligation whereas Sundberg J did analyse this issue at 12
06_1228.xml,c1,discussed,Yazbeck v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCA 980 ; (2002) 124 FCR 458,8 Clause 1002214 provides that  The applicant meets the requirements of this subclause if    a the applicant first entered Australia as the holder of a Subclass 309 Spouse Provisional visa and either    i continues to be the holder of that visa or  ii is no longer the holder of that visa because the visa     A was granted before 1 November 1999 and  B has ceased to be in effect because the applicant     I was outside Australia at the end of the 30 month period specified in the Subclass 309 visa for travelling to and entering Australia or  II left Australia after the end of the 30 month period specified in that visa for travelling to and entering Australia and    b the applicant would meet the requirements of subclause 2 or 2A except that the relationship between the applicant and the sponsoring spouse has ceased and  c after the applicant first entered Australia as the holder of the visa mentioned in paragraph a  either or both of the following circumstances applies    i either or both of the following  A the applicant  B a member of a family unit of the sponsoring spouse or of the applicant or of both of them  has suffered domestic violence committed by the sponsoring spouse  ii the applicant  A has custody or joint custody of or access to or  B has a residence order or contact order made under the Family Law Act 1975 relating to  at least 1 child in respect of whom the sponsoring spouse  C has been granted joint custody or access by a court or  D has a residence order or contact order made under the Family Law Act 1975  or  E has an obligation under a child maintenance order made under the Family Law Act 1975  or any other formal maintenance obligation9 Custody is defined in reg 103 as follows  Custody  in relation to a child means   a the right to have the daily care and control of the child and  b the right and responsibility to make decisions concerning the daily care and control of the child10 The events leading up to the Tribunals decision require some explanation On 22 April 2004 the Tribunal wrote to the appellant inviting him to comment on information in the Departmental file indicating the sponsor had taken out an AVO against him and that they were no longer in a spousal relationship The appellant responded by letter dated 24 April 2004 indicating that although the AVO had been taken out we have since resolved our issues and there has been no violence since He also stated that he and the sponsor lived together and that they had a daughter On 28 April 2004 the Tribunal again wrote to the appellant inviting the appellant to appear before the Tribunal at a hearing and provided the relevant hearing details The letter stated that the Tribunal wished to take oral evidence at the hearing from the appellant as well as from the sponsor On 10 May 2004 the Tribunal received a completed response to hearing invitation form which was signed by the sponsor In response to the typed statement I request that the Tribunal take oral evidence from was written English Fatima Mustapha his wife Under I request that the Tribunal obtain the following written evidence or written materials was written the sponsors address and name followed by the words his wife34 The construction of the wording in clause 1002214cii has previously been considered in two decisions of this Court in both cases by a single judge The first is the judgment of Sundberg J in Yazbeck v Minister for Immigration  Multicultural Affairs 2002 FCA 980  2002 124 FCR 458  Yazbeck  The applicant in that case had been refused a permanent visa of the same type as that applied for in the present case Also as in the present appeal the delegate had refused to grant the permanent visa on the basis that the relationship was not genuine and continuing and the Tribunal reached the same view In his amended application in this Court the applicant contended that the Tribunal had erred in not finding that he satisfied items A and E of subclause 1002214 The Tribunal had before it evidence that the applicant had recently seen the two children of his marriage to the sponsor at a cousins house which the applicant claimed established that he had access to the children for the purposes of item A The applicant relied on s 66C of the Family Law Act for the claim that his former spouse had a formal maintenance order for the purposes of par E Subsection 66C1 of the Family Law Act  which is virtually identical to s 3 of the Assessment Act  provides  The parents of a child have subject to this Division the primary duty to maintain the child35 In construing item A his Honour considered the relationship between subclause 1002214 and the amendments to the Family Law Act at 7 9 Prior to amendments effected by the Family Law Reform Act 1995 the 1995 Act  Part VII of the old Act had provided for custody and access orders The 1995 Act introduced parenting orders in a new Part VII  to replace those orders His Honour set out s 64B of the Family Law Act which defines a parenting order as dealing with any aspect of parental responsibility for a child including with whom the child is to live residence orders and contact between the child and another person or persons contact orders Subclause 1002214cii uses both the old terms custody and access as well as the new terms residence and contact and was intended by the drafters to accommodate both types of orders His Honour then considered the discrepancy in the words between items A and B being that B expressly referred to orders made under the Family Law Act whereas item A does not His Honour concluded that the omission of a reference to orders in item A was to be explained by bad drafting His Honour found that this view was supported by the terms of item C which refers to the situation where the spouse was granted joint custody or access by a court His Honour described items A and C as counterparts explaining this description by giving the example that clause C deals only with the sponsor having joint custody because clause A deals with sole custody36 Having found that custody and access in item A referred to the concepts under the old Family Law Act  his Honour concluded that the Tribunal had been correct in finding that there was no evidence of custody or access before it His Honour noted that There was no evidence that a court order existed that entitled the applicant to access the children at 937 However his Honour should not necessarily be taken to have excluded the possibility that something less than a court order could establish access His Honour said at 10  Even if a person can for the purposes of subclause 1002214iiA have access to a child in the absence of a court order granting access the applicant does not establish that he has access simply because he happens to have seen the child whether close up or in the distance Evidence that the applicant saw his children recently and his wife at a cousins house does not established that he has access to his children It must be said however that his Honour does appear to indicate a view that the lack of any reference to court orders in item A was merely a drafting oversight38 Having found that item A was not satisfied his Honour said that the applicants case would not be assisted even if he succeeded in his claims in relation to item E Nevertheless his Honour turned to consider whether the applicants spouse had a formal maintenance obligation for the purposes of item E by virtue of s 66C1 of the Family Law Act  His Honour broke up item E into two limbs being an obligation under a child maintenance order made under made under the Family Law Act 1975  and any other formal maintenance obligation The first limb was a type of order under the Family Law Act specifying the amount of maintenance to be provided His Honour found that the type of obligations to which the second limb was directed was maintenance agreements made in writing by the parties to a marriage addressing the maintenance of a child and which are regulated by the Family Law Act  It was not clear whether or not his Honour viewed this as being the only type of obligation which would satisfy the second limb39 His Honour also considered the result of the applicants contention in relation to s 66C  if it was accepted His Honour said at 12  If the duty imposed by s 66C1 were a formal maintenance obligation pars C and D would be rendered unnecessary as would the first limb of par E Any applicant whose relationship with the sponsoring spouse had ceased and who satisfied par A or par B would as a result of s 66C1  automatically satisfy the second limb of par E This would be an absurd result which is avoided by the approach I favour Thereby effect is given to pars C and D and both parts of par E rather than rendering pars C and D and the first part of par E ineffectual45 Dowsett J was mindful of the apparent inconsistency with Sundberg Js decision in Yazbeck and discussed that decision at some length at 30 to 38 Prior to considering the decision in Yazbeck  Dowsett J considered the meaning of residence order contact order and child maintenance order used in items B D and E and notes that the terms were introduced by the 1995 amendments to the Family Law Act  His Honour also notes that prior to the 1995 amendments the terms custody orders access orders and maintenance orders were traditionally used and the meanings of those terms46 Dowsett J agreed with Sundberg Js conclusion in Yazbeck that the Tribunal in that case had correctly concluded that the applicant did not have access on the basis of having recently seen his children at a cousins house Dowsett Js reasoning was that Item A contemplates some form of continuing access rather than one previous incident of contact at 31 His Honour then went on to consider the aspects of Sundberg Js judgment which appeared to go further First there was the issue of the relevance of the express reference in items B D and E to orders made under the Family Law Act 1975  and to rights granted by a court in the case of item C whereas item A does not contain any such a reference Dowsett J did not accept Sundberg Js analysis concluding it was more likely to reflect deliberate decisions than bad drafting at 32 In reaching this conclusion his Honour did not embrace Sundberg Js approach to items A and C as counterparts which analysis had apparently been a major part of Sundberg Js reasoning Dowsett J observed that an approach to items A and C as counterparts seemed to assume that only the visa applicant and sponsor had any direct interest in the relevant child whereas there was no reason to assume this especially since there was no requirement that the child be the biological child of either person His Honour also observed that even assuming only the visa applicant and sponsor had direct links item C does not provide a counterpart to item A for a case where a visa applicant has access since sole custody by the sponsor will not satisfy item C Although his Honour discusses some possible purposes of items A to E and their interaction at 33 his ultimate view was that it was very difficult to understand these matters entirely and that the best course was probably to give each item its natural meaning unless some absurdity results at 3547 Dowsett J considered Sundberg Js conclusion that item A was intended to deal with custody and access orders under the old Family Law Act  Dowsett J noted that as Sundberg J had himself pointed out the amended Act gives effect to orders made under the old Act custody and access orders as if they were orders made under the amended Act residence and contact orders On that basis his Honour concluded that item B applied both to orders made under the old Act and the amended Act and that item A must have been intended to deal with arrangements other than orders made under the old Act at 3648 Dowsett J considered Sundberg Js conclusion that an absurdity would arise if s 66C of the Family Law Act satisfied item E Dowsett J did not accept with Sundberg Js analysis that where a visa applicant satisfied item A or B the second limb of item E would automatically be satisfied and that items C and D would thereby be rendered unnecessary Dowsett J noted this analysis again assumed that the relevant child must be the biological or perhaps adopted child of either the visa applicant or the sponsor Since s 66C applies only to parents which exclude for example stepparents and yet orders referred to in items C and D can be made in respect of nonparents items C and D still had work to do On Dowsett Js reasoning the second limb of item E would not automatically be satisfied where a visa applicant satisfied items A or B since it could not be assumed that the sponsor was a parent for the purposes of s 66C49 Dowsett J also considered the policy implications of construing item A as requiring court orders telling against the construction favoured by Sundberg J at 34   I see no reason why the Migration Regulations would discriminate for present purposes between recognized rights and obligations existing at law but not evidenced in any order or other formal document and rights and obligations which are so evidenced Such discrimination would encourage unnecessary litigation50 His Honour also questioned at 32 why bona fide consensus as to a childs welfare should not be sufficient in the context of considering why item A should be construed as requiring court orders51 Dowsett J concluded by expressing his reluctance in reaching a different conclusion on item E than Sundberg J adding that it was arguable that Sundberg Js decision on the issue did not form part of the ratio Dowsett J also offered as explanations for the different decision that it was based upon the evidentiary shortcomings of the applicants case and that his Honour did not have the benefit of argument on the wider aspects of the matter at 3954 Counsel for the Minister also submitted that in any event Yazbec should be preferred to Fitch She submitted that following Yazbec  the Tribunal did not have before it evidence of a formal maintenance obligation and did not err by proceeding to make a decision under s 359A when such information was not forthcoming The main basis on which it was contended that Yazbec should be preferred was that Sundberg J took a more thorough and orthodox approach to statutory construction particularly in relation to the term formal maintenance obligation in item E Counsel contended that the approach of Dowsett J in Fitch gave no meaning to the term formal rendering it otiose and with no work to do This was contrary to a proper approach to statutory construction It was submitted that Dowsett J did not undertake a proper assessment of the term formal maintenance obligation in reaching his conclusion and in particular that he did not consider the difference between a maintenance obligation and a formal maintenance obligation whereas Sundberg J did analyse this

part of the appeal papers or before the trial judge during the course of argument before me two documents were produced One was headed About Visa 485 and I was informed by counsel for the Minister that its provisions applied as the policy at the time at which the appellant made his original application for a visa Unhelpfully it did not set out criteria for the purposes of assessing whether cl 845216 should be interpreted in any particular way but simply referred to another policy for those criteria The policy in effect for the period 11 May 2005 to 15 June 2005 being the period in which the Tribunals decision was given was also produced It set out in par 81 criteria for the purposes of cl 845216 materially identical to those the subject of consideration by a Full Court of this Court in Lobo v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs 2003 FCAFC 168  2003 132 FCR 93 at 101102 30 The terms of par 81 of the policy were    81 The policy intention of this criterion overall is to establish whether the applicant has the ability to manage and operate a main business successfully   Under policy it requires sic the applicant to demonstrate that        they have exercised responsibility within the main businesses in terms of decisionmaking authority responsibility for employees andor responsibility for expenditure    such responsibility has been exercised on a continuous as opposed to on an occasional basis and    their skills have been fundamental to or have exerted direct influence on the operation of the main businesses       The success or otherwise of the businesses is not a relevant factor in assessing this criterion Rather if an applicant satisfies this criterion in respect of a failed or declining business this should be considered in assessing whether the applicant has overall had a successful business careerThe Full Court held following a concession by the Minister that the requirements of the identically worded policy did not correspond to the requirements of the Regulations The court said 132 FCR at 112 63 that    the departmental policy  was narrower than the criterion for a subclass 845 visa set out in cl 845216  The criterion requires satisfaction on the part of the Minister that the applicant for the visa as owner of and interested in a main business maintain direct and continuous involvement in the management of that business or in those businesses from day to day and in making decisions that affected the overall direction and performance of that business or those businesses This did not import a requirement that could only be satisfied by demonstrating the exercise of responsibility within the business in terms of decisionmaking authority responsibility for employees andor responsibility for expenditure There is a variety of ways in which a person might maintain direct and continuous involvement in the management of a business and in making decisions affecting its overall direction and performance emphasis addedThe trial judge adopted the submission of the Minister that the Tribunals approach to this issue was not a misconstruction of the requirements of a statutory criterion for the granting of a visa by applying a policy which was narrower than the criterion in cl 845216 in contrast to Lobo v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs 2003 FCAFC 168  2003 132 FCR 93 Rather his Honour in adopting the Ministers submission found that it was clear from the Tribunals decision that it had applied the very words of the enactment in the passages at 3033 to which I have referred and that the case was no more than a merits review as opposed to an error going to jurisdictionI do not agree The Tribunals obligation was to conduct a review of the decision of the delegate s 3481 In performing that review it had power to exercise all of the powers and discretions that were conferred by the Act on the person who made the decision s 349 And having made a decision the Tribunal was obliged to prepare a written statement under s 3681 which set out     the decision of the Tribunal on review  its reasons for that decision  the findings on any material questions of fact and  references to the evidence or any other material on which those findings of fact were basedI am of opinion that the Tribunal did not in its reasons for decision set out the evidence or any other material on which the ultimate findings of fact to which it came in relation to cl 845216 were based There was nothing in the findings or other material set out in its reasons that enabled it to come to the conclusion that it could not be satisfied on the issue of the appellants involvement in the businessThe Tribunal expressly said that it had considered policy in arriving at its lack of satisfaction that the appellant had met the criteria of cl 845216 Here the Tribunal appears to have been misled by its reliance on the unlawful constriction which par 81 of the policy sought to put on the proper interpretation of cl 845216 as held in Lobo v Minister 2003 FCAFC 168  2003 132 FCR 93 As their Honours held a want of satisfaction of the criteria set out in the policy would not equate to a want of satisfaction of the criterion in cl 845216 And an assessment by the Tribunal in which as it said it was required to have regard to that policy and apply it unless there were cogent reasons for departing from it involves jurisdictional error because the Tribunal applied the policy rather than the criteria in cl 845216 132 FCR at 112 6369The Tribunal made an error of law in that it did not correctly understand and apply the criteria in cl 845216 Nor did it give any reasons for its conclusion in that regard Each was a failure to conduct that part of the review in accordance with law being a requirement to decide whether or not the appellant met the criteria for cl 845216 And this was also a jurisdictional error  Lobo v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs 2003 132 FCR at 112 6465The second argument related to whether or not the appellant met the requirements of Pt 3 of Schedule 7 of the Regulations for the purposes of cl 8452221 Under that clause a notice in the Gazette can establish the number of points required for the business skills points test to be satisfied The notice for present purposes required 105 points It is not in issue that the appellant was entitled to 10 points by reason if his age being between 50 and 55 years and was entitled to 60 points because the business with which he was involved in the 12 months immediately preceding the making of his application met the criteria specified in Div 14 of Schedule 7 in cl 7170 Accordingly he had 70 points from those two criteria He needed another 35 points to satisfy the test in the notice in the GazetteThe Tribunal assessed appellant as being of limited ability in English and gave him 10 points for that item It then found that it was not satisfied with the estimates of value which the appellant had given for his assets and was not satisfied he had net assets of more than 15 million at the hearing but was satisfied of him having at

06_1229.xml,c8,applied,Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Wang [2003] HCA 11 ; (2003) 215 CLR 518,This raises a tension between a consideration of the way in which a court must assess the impact of a jurisdictional error that is found and its bearing on the overall decision In Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Wang 2003 HCA 11  2003 215 CLR 518 at 541542 74 Gummow and Hayne JJ said that    to attempt to divorce the Tribunals statement of its findings on what it considered to be a material question of fact from the decision it made and in particular from its reasons may be dangerous in cases like the present where it is accepted that the Tribunal made an error of law There are several reasons why it may be a dangerous process First there is the notorious difficulty of disentangling findings of fact from conclusions about applicable legal principle Secondly assuming that those difficulties can be surmounted the findings of fact which the Tribunal makes after hearing and assessing the body of material and submissions will necessarily reflect the Tribunals conclusions about applicable legal principle and will be directed to the questions that those principles present  Their Honours went on to say  If in that review the Tribunal makes an error of law and a subsequent review is ordered what is the Tribunal then to do if the further findings are to be made about subjects with which the first Tribunal dealt For it to take as its starting point findings that were made on that earlier review under a misapprehension of applicable legal principles may indeed often would skew the second factual inquiry by the TribunalTheir Honours then noted that by contrast if no more findings needed to be made on the second review because only one conclusion was lawfully open to the Tribunal on the findings that it made at the first the difficulties to which they had referred would be much reduced if not eliminatedThe Tribunals function here as the Minister pointed out involved consideration of the situation at two points of time for certain matters Under cll 84521 and 845221 some criteria such as those under cl 845216 had to be satisfied at the times of both the application and the decision Additionally under cl 84522 further criteria had to be satisfied at the time of the decision Under cl 8452222bii the appellants score on the business skills points test is calculated as the sum of his scores for present purposes at the time when the application for the visa was made Under cl 8452222c certain assets only are to be valued or assessed for value in determining whether an applicant meets the points criteria under Pt 4 of Schedule 7 of the Regulations see items 74017404I am of opinion that when a matter is remitted under Div 4 Pt 5 of the Act to the Tribunal for further hearing and determination according to law similar reasoning applies The way in which that review is undertaken is similar to the task of the Refugee Review Tribunal in like circumstances see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Wang 2003 HCA 11  2003 215 CLR 518 and SZEPZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs 2006 FCAFC 107 see esp at 3536The fact that the appellant had not satisfied the points test in each criterion in a decision which is set aside would be a matter that the Tribunal could take into account if it had to complete its review although it would be able to review the question afresh as Gummow and Hayne JJ pointed out in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Wang 2003 HCA 11  2003 215 CLR 518 Indeed in Applicant VEAL of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs 2005 HCA 72  2005 222 ALR 411 Gleeson CJ Gummow Kirby Hayne and Heydon JJ held that a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal was affected by jurisdictional error where the tribunal had reached a decision to refuse a visa to an applicant and had said that it had given no weight to a confidential letter The visa applicant was ignorant of the existence of the letter which contained credible relevant and significant material which was adverse to the visa applicant Their Honours said   It follows that asking whether despite what was said in its reasons the Tribunal may have been subconsciously affected by the information distracts attention from the relevant inquiry The relevant inquiry is what procedures should have been followed The relevant inquiry is neither what decision should the decisionmaker have made nor what reasons did the decisionmaker give for the conclusion reached 222 ALR at 417 19

06_1229.xml,c15,considered,Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs Ex parte Durairajasingham [2000] HCA 1 ; (2000) 74 ALJR 405,The Minister relied on remarks of McHugh J in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs Ex parte Durairajasingham 2000 HCA 1  2000 74 ALJR 405 and in particular I apprehend at 412413 3536 and 416418 6070 that in effect the Tribunal in stating its reasons for decision was entitled to make findings of fact and was not required to go through line by line each item of evidence or each relevant matter and deal with it in turn accepting or dismissing it So much may be acceptedThe Minister also argued that the decision required under s 65 of the Migration Act 1958 Cth the Act was whether or not the Tribunal standing in the shoes of the Minister as the decisionmaker was satisfied of the matters set out in the Regulations for the purposes of granting the visa for which the appellant applied She contended that findings along the way were not ones which went to jurisdictionI am of opinion that it was not open to the Tribunal on the basis only of the findings it set out to find that a person in a single business that consists of running one retail trading shop who makes decisions daily about placing orders and pricing of goods offered for sale and had done so for over one year prior to his application without any suggestion of supervision or control did not have direct and continuous involvement in the management of that business from day to day or in making decisions that affect the overall direction and performance of that business The Tribunal did not express any finding or reason for that ultimate conclusion except that it did not find the evidence compellingAs McHugh J pointed out in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Durairajasingham 2000 HCA 1  2000 74 ALJR 405 at 417 70 the requirements of s 368 are that the Tribunal give a written but not lengthy explanation of the decision already madeI am of opinion that there was an absence of any reason factual finding or reference to facts expressed in the Tribunals reasons that could show that a person who had the duties and performed the functions of the appellant in the business during the period which the Tribunal was considering namely the year prior to his visa application being lodged did not satisfy the criteria of cl 845216Having regard to the Tribunals expressed findings and reasons its decision on this issue was so unreasonable that no reasonable decisionmaker could have come to it on the basis expressed in those findings and reasons That is not to say that another tribunal could not come to the same decision but if it did so it would have to apply the law correctly make findings and give reasons which were capable of supporting the decisionI can see no error of approach in the way that the Tribunal dealt with this matter It was entitled to form a view as to whether or not what had been put to it by the appellant satisfied it as to the value of his assets This was as McHugh J said in the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Durairajasingham 2000 74 ALJR at 417 67 a finding on inter alia credibility or establishment of facts which was the function of a primary decisionmaker par excellence I do not consider that the Tribunal has been shown to have erred or not performed its function of review of the application in this respectThe question arises of how the matter ought then be resolvedThe Minister has raised an issue of some difficulty She says that the Tribunal may have erred in the way in which I have found but that nonetheless even if one accepts that result the application would be rejected on reconsideration by the Tribunal That is because even if the Tribunal formed a more favourable view on first the issue under cl 845216 and then secondly on the language issue and awarded the appellant 10 more points he would still be 10 points short of the 105 required to satisfy the points

attract privilege if it was brought into existence for the dominant purpose of giving or obtaining legal advice Esso Australia Resources Limited v Commissioner of Taxation 1999 HCA 67  1999 201 CLR 49  Esso  at 6465 35 Daniels Corporations International Pty Ltd v Australian Competition  Consumer Commission 2002 HCA 49  2002 213 CLR 543  Daniels  at 552 9The general principles that I consider relevant to the disposition of this case can be summarised as follows   1 The party claiming privilege carries the onus of proving that the communication was undertaken or the document was brought into existence for the dominant purpose of giving or obtaining legal advice The onus might be discharged by evidence as to the circumstances and context in which the communications occurred or the documents were brought into existence or by evidence as to the purposes of the person who made the communication or authored the document or procured its creation It might also be discharged by reference to the nature of the documents supported by argument or submissions see Grant v Downs 1976 HCA 63  1976 135 CLR 674  Grant v Downs  at 689 Commissioner of Taxation v Pratt Holdings Pty Ltd 2005 225 ALR 266 at 278 30  FCT v Pratt Holdings  and AWB v Cole at 63 2 The purpose for which a document is brought into existence is a question of fact that must be determined objectively Evidence of the intention of the documents maker or of the person who authorised or procured it is not necessarily conclusive It may be necessary to examine the evidence concerning the purpose of other persons involved in the hierarchy of decisionmaking or consultation that led to the creation of the document and its subsequent communication see AWB v Cole at 110  3 The existence of legal professional privilege is not established merely by the use of verbal formula Grant v Downs at 689 per Stephen Mason and Murphy JJ Nor is a claim of privilege established by mere assertion that privilege applies to particular communications or that communications are undertaken for the purpose of obtaining or giving legal advice National Crime Authority v S 1991 29 FCR 203 at 211 212 per Lockhart J Candacal Pty Ltd v Industry Research  Development Board 2005 223 ALR 284  Candacal  at 298 70 Seven Network Limited v News Limited 2005 FCA 142 at 6 8 If assertions of that kind are received in evidence in support of the privilege claim their conclusionary nature can leave unclear what advice was really being sought There will be cases in which a claim of privilege will not be sustainable in the absence of evidence identifying the circumstances in which the relevant communication took place and the topics to which the instructions or advice were directed Kennedy v Wallace 2004 FCAFC 337  2004 142 FCR

6 2001 SASC 398  4 Where communications take place between a client and his or her independent legal advisers or between a clients inhouse lawyers and those legal advisers it may be appropriate to assume that legitimate legal advice was being sought absent any contrary indications Kennedy v Wallace 2004 208 ALR 424 at 442 65 per Gyles J affirmed on appeal Kennedy v Wallace at 191192 2327 per Black CJ and Emmett J In Kennedy v Wallace  Black CJ and Emmett J inclined to the view that in the ordinary case of a client consulting a lawyer about a legal problem in uncontroversial circumstances proof of those facts alone will provide a sufficient basis for a conclusion that legitimate legal advice is being sought or given  5 A dominant purpose is one that predominates over other purposes it is the prevailing or paramount purpose AWB v Cole at 105106 FCT v Pratt Holdings at 279280 30 per Kenny J 6 An appropriate starting point when applying the dominant purpose test is to ask what was the

disputed claim the High Court has said that the court should not be hesitant to exercise such a power Esso  see also Grant v Downs at 689 If the power is exercised the court will need to recognise

06_1234.xml,c3,cited,Waterford v Commonwealth [1987] HCA 25 ; (1987) 163 CLR 54,AWB placed particular reliance on Dawson Js formulation of the scope of legal advice privilege in Waterford v Commonwealth 1987 HCA 25  1987 163 CLR 54 at 95   The legal professional privilege relied upon in this case is that which attaches to communications between a legal adviser and his client for the purpose of giving or receiving legal advice and to documents recording those communications or containing information for the purpose of enabling the advice to be given In order to attract that privilege the communications must be confidential and the legal adviser must be acting in his professional capacity see Minet v Morgan  Wheeler v Le Marchant  Smith v Daniell  Bullivant v AttorneyGeneral Vict  Jones v Great Central Railway Co  ORourke v Darbishire    There is nothing controversial about this formulation of the principleThe general principles that I consider relevant to the disposition of this case can be summarised as follows   1 The party claiming privilege carries the onus of proving that the communication was undertaken or the document was brought into existence for the dominant purpose of giving or obtaining legal advice The onus might be discharged by evidence as to the circumstances and context in which the communications occurred or the documents were brought into existence or by evidence as to the purposes of the person who made the communication or authored the document or procured its creation It might also be discharged by reference to the nature of the documents supported by argument or submissions see Grant v Downs 1976 HCA 63  1976 135 CLR 674  Grant v Downs  at 689 Commissioner of Taxation v Pratt Holdings Pty Ltd 2005 225 ALR 266 at 278 30  FCT v Pratt Holdings  and AWB v Cole at 63 2 The purpose for which a document is brought into existence is a question of fact that must be determined objectively Evidence of the intention of the documents maker or of the person who authorised or procured it is not necessarily conclusive It may be necessary to examine the evidence concerning the purpose of other persons involved in the hierarchy of decisionmaking or consultation that led to the creation of the document and its subsequent communication see AWB v Cole at 110  3 The existence of legal professional privilege is not established merely by the use of verbal formula Grant v Downs at 689 per Stephen Mason and Murphy JJ Nor is a claim of privilege established by mere assertion that privilege applies to particular communications or that communications are undertaken for the purpose of obtaining or giving legal advice National Crime Authority v S 1991 29 FCR 203 at 211 212 per Lockhart J Candacal Pty Ltd v Industry Research  Development Board 2005 223 ALR 284  Candacal  at 298 70 Seven Network Limited v News Limited 2005 FCA 142 at 6 8 If assertions of that kind are received in evidence in support of the privilege claim their conclusionary nature can leave unclear what advice was really being sought There will be cases in which a claim of privilege will not be sustainable in the absence of evidence identifying the circumstances in which the relevant communication took place and the topics to which the instructions or advice were directed Kennedy v Wallace 2004 FCAFC 337  2004 142 FCR

6 2001 SASC 398  4 Where communications take place between a client and his or her independent legal advisers or between a clients inhouse lawyers and those legal advisers it may be appropriate to assume that legitimate legal advice was being sought absent any contrary indications Kennedy v Wallace 2004 208 ALR 424 at 442 65 per Gyles J affirmed on appeal Kennedy v Wallace at 191192 2327 per Black CJ and Emmett J In Kennedy v Wallace  Black CJ and Emmett J inclined to the view that in the ordinary case of a client consulting a lawyer about a legal problem in uncontroversial circumstances

06_1234.xml,c6,cited,National Crime Authority v S (1991) 29 FCR 203,The general principles that I consider relevant to the disposition of this case can be summarised as follows   1 The party claiming privilege carries the onus of proving that the communication was undertaken or the document was brought into existence for the dominant purpose of giving or obtaining legal advice The onus might be discharged by evidence as to the circumstances and context in which the communications occurred or the documents were brought into existence or by evidence as to the purposes of the person who made the communication or authored the document or procured its creation It might also be discharged by reference to the nature of the documents supported by argument or submissions see Grant v Downs 1976

document is brought into existence is a question of fact that must be determined objectively Evidence of the intention of the documents maker or of the person who authorised or procured it is not necessarily conclusive It may be necessary to examine the evidence concerning the purpose of other persons involved in the hierarchy of decisionmaking or consultation that led to the creation of the document and its subsequent communication see AWB v Cole at 110  3 The existence of legal professional privilege is not established merely by the use of verbal formula Grant v Downs at 689 per Stephen Mason and Murphy JJ Nor is a claim of privilege established by mere assertion that privilege applies to particular communications or that communications are undertaken for the purpose of obtaining or giving legal advice National Crime Authority v S 1991 29 FCR 203 at 211 212 per Lockhart J Candacal Pty Ltd v Industry Research  Development Board 2005 223 ALR 284  Candacal  at 298 70 Seven Network Limited v News Limited 2005 FCA 142 at 6 8 If assertions of that kind are received in evidence in support of the privilege claim their conclusionary nature can leave unclear what advice was really being sought There will be cases in which a claim of privilege will not be sustainable in the absence of evidence identifying the circumstances in which the relevant communication took place and the topics to which the instructions or advice were directed Kennedy v Wallace 2004 FCAFC 337  2004 142 FCR 185  Kennedy v Wallace  at 189 190 12 17 per Black CJ and Emmett J and at 211 212 144 145 and at

the ordinary case of a client consulting a lawyer about a legal problem in uncontroversial circumstances proof of those facts alone will provide a sufficient basis for a conclusion that legitimate legal advice is being sought or given  5 A dominant purpose is one that predominates over other purposes it is the prevailing or paramount purpose AWB v Cole at 105106 FCT v Pratt Holdings at 279280

Pratt Holdings Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation 2004 FCAFC 122  2004 136 FCR 357 at 366 35 per Finn J 7 The concept of legal advice is fairly wide It extends to professional advice as to what a

2002 1 Qd R 233 at 245 However in Commonwealth v Vance 2005 158 ACTR 47 the Full Court Gray Connolly and Tamberlin JJ did not regard the possession of a current practising certificate as an essential precondition to the availability of legal professional privilege at 23 35 The same view was taken by Lee J in Candacal at 303 99 by Gillard J in Australian Hospital Care Pindara Pty Ltd v Duggan 1999

to the persons seeking to execute the warrant and if no unprivileged copy or other admissible evidence is made available to prove the contents of the original the otherwise privileged copy loses its protection  12 The Court has power to examine documents over which legal professional privilege is claimed Where there is a disputed claim the High Court has said that the court should not be hesitant to exercise such a power Esso  see also Grant v Downs at 689 If the power is exercised the court will need to recognise that it does not have the benefit of submissions or evidence that might place the document in its proper context The essential purpose of such an inspection is to determine whether on its face the nature and content of the document supports the claim for legal professional privilege
06_1234.xml,c13,approved,Balabel v Air India [1988] 1 Ch 317,The general principles that I consider relevant to the disposition of this case can be summarised as follows   1 The party claiming privilege carries the onus of proving that the communication was undertaken or the document was brought into existence for the dominant purpose of giving or obtaining legal advice The onus might be discharged by evidence as to the circumstances and context in which the communications occurred or the documents were brought into existence or by evidence as to the purposes of the person who made the communication or authored the document or procured its creation It might also be discharged by reference to the nature of the documents supported by argument or submissions see Grant v Downs 1976 HCA 63  1976 135 CLR 674  Grant v Downs  at 689 Commissioner of Taxation v Pratt Holdings Pty Ltd 2005 225 ALR 266 at 278 30  FCT v Pratt Holdings  and AWB v Cole at 63 2 The purpose for which a document is brought into existence is a question of fact that must be determined objectively Evidence of the intention of the documents maker or of the person who authorised or procured it is not necessarily conclusive It may be necessary to examine the evidence concerning the purpose of other persons involved in the hierarchy of decisionmaking or consultation that led to the creation of the document and its subsequent communication see AWB v Cole at 110  3 The existence of legal professional privilege is not established merely by the use of verbal formula Grant v Downs at 689 per Stephen Mason and Murphy JJ Nor is a claim of privilege established by mere assertion that privilege applies to particular communications or that communications are undertaken for the purpose of obtaining or giving legal advice National Crime Authority v S 1991 29 FCR 203 at 211 212 per Lockhart J Candacal Pty Ltd v Industry Research  Development Board 2005 223 ALR 284  Candacal  at 298 70 Seven Network Limited v News Limited 2005 FCA 142 at 6 8 If assertions of that kind are received in evidence in support of the privilege claim their conclusionary nature can leave unclear what advice was really being sought There will be cases in which a claim of privilege will not be sustainable in the absence of evidence identifying the circumstances in which the relevant communication took place and the topics to which the instructions or advice were directed Kennedy v Wallace 2004 FCAFC 337  2004 142 FCR 185  Kennedy v Wallace  at 189 190 12 17 per Black CJ and Emmett J and at 211 212 144 145 and at

Pratt Holdings Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation 2004 FCAFC 122  2004 136 FCR 357 at 366 35 per Finn J 7 The concept of legal advice is fairly wide It extends to professional advice as to what a

retained for the purposes of providing legal advice in relation to a particular transaction or series of transactions communications between the lawyer and the client relating to that transaction will be privileged notwithstanding that they do not contain advice on matters of law it is enough that they are directly related to the performance by the lawyer of his or her professional duty as legal adviser to the client Minter v Priest 1930 AC 558 at 581 586 Balabel at 330 Nederlandse at 983 and Dalleagles at 332 333 In Dalleagles  Anderson J said at 332 333 that professional discourse in a professional capacity between a solicitor and his client with reference to the transactions covered by his instructions should be regarded as prima facie for the purpose of giving and receiving advice In his Honours view this would apply to any communication that is on its face a communication of a professional nature from the solicitor to the client or his agent touching the subject matter of the solicitors engagement and any communication from the client to the solicitor in connection with that engagement These propositions were referred to with approval by Allsop J in DSE at 5152 and by Branson J in Wenkart v Commissioner of Federal Police unreported Federal Court Branson J 11 November 1996In DSE  Allsop J said that there was no substantive difference between the views expressed in Balabel and Dalleagles  at 51 52 and 71 Allsop J also observed that what underlies the expression of opinion in those cases is the recognition that the obligation of the lawyer to advise once retained is pervasive In his Honours view it would be rare that one could with any degree of confidence say that a communication between client and lawyer in the circumstances of a retainer requiring legal advice and the directing of the client by a legal adviser was not connected with the provision or requesting of legal advice Indeed too literal a requirement of identifying legal advice as express advice about the law would place undue emphasis on formalism and undermine the privilege Rix J as his Lordship then was expressed much the same view in Hellenic Mutual War Risks Associated Bermuda Ltd

at 150 Glengallan Investments Pty Ltd v Arthur Andersen 2002 1 Qd R 233 at 245 However in Commonwealth v Vance 2005 158 ACTR 47 the Full Court Gray Connolly and Tamberlin JJ did not regard the possession of a current practising certificate as an essential precondition to the availability of legal professional privilege at 23 35 The same view was taken by Lee J in Candacal at 303 99 by Gillard J in Australian Hospital Care Pindara Pty Ltd v Duggan 1999 VSC 131 at 111  and by Downes J in Re McKinnon and Secretary Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade 2004 AATA 1365  2004 86 ALD 780 at 785 51  11 Legal professional privilege protects communications rather than documents as the test for privilege is anchored to the purpose for which the document was brought into existence Consequently legal professional privilege can attach to copies of nonprivileged documents if the purpose of bringing the copy into existence satisfies the dominant purpose test Propend at 507 per Brennan CJ 544 per Gaudron J 553554 per McHugh J 571572 per Gummow J and 587 per Kirby J In Propend at 512 Brennan CJ added a qualification to this principle if an original unprivileged document is not in existence or its location is not disclosed or is not accessible to the persons seeking to execute the warrant and if no unprivileged copy or other admissible evidence is made available to prove the contents of the original the otherwise privileged copy loses its protection  12 The Court has power to examine documents over which legal professional privilege is claimed Where there is a disputed claim the High Court has said that the court should not be hesitant to exercise such a power Esso  see also Grant v Downs at 689 If the power is exercised the court will need to recognise that it does not have the benefit of submissions or evidence that might place the document in its proper context The essential purpose of such an inspection is to determine whether on its face the nature and content of the document supports the claim for legal professional privilegeIn Three Rivers  the relevant legal context consisted of a commission of inquiry into the part played by the Bank of England in the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA The House of Lords upheld the Bank of Englands claim that legal advice privilege attached to documents that had been generated for the purposes of providing information to the Banks legal advisers to enable them to prepare submissions and evidence and to advise on the nature presentation timing and content of the Banks responses to the inquiry Relevant passages from the speeches in the House of Lords are extracted in my decision in AWB v Cole at 92 96
06_1234.xml,c16,considered,Dalleagles Pty Ltd v Australian Securities Commission (1991) 4 WAR 325,The general principles that I consider relevant to the disposition of this case can be summarised as follows   1 The party claiming privilege carries the onus of proving that the communication was undertaken or the document was brought into existence for the dominant purpose of giving or obtaining legal advice The onus might be discharged by evidence as to the circumstances and context in which the communications occurred or the documents were brought into existence or by evidence as to the purposes of the person who made the communication or authored the document or procured its creation It might also be discharged by reference to the nature of the documents supported by argument or submissions see Grant v Downs 1976 HCA 63  1976 135 CLR 674  Grant v Downs  at 689 Commissioner of Taxation v Pratt Holdings Pty Ltd 2005 225 ALR 266 at 278 30  FCT v Pratt Holdings  and AWB v Cole at 63 2 The purpose for which a document is brought into existence is a question of fact that must be determined objectively Evidence of the intention of the documents maker or of the person who authorised or procured it is not necessarily conclusive It may be necessary to examine the evidence concerning the purpose of other persons involved in the hierarchy of decisionmaking or consultation that led to the creation of the document and its subsequent communication see AWB v Cole at 110  3 The existence of legal professional privilege is not established merely by the use of verbal formula Grant v Downs at 689 per Stephen Mason and Murphy JJ Nor is a claim of privilege established by mere assertion that privilege applies to particular communications or that communications are undertaken for the purpose of obtaining or giving legal advice National Crime Authority v S 1991 29 FCR 203 at 211 212 per Lockhart J Candacal Pty Ltd v Industry Research  Development Board 2005 223 ALR 284

unclear what advice was really being sought There will be cases in which a claim of privilege will not be sustainable in the absence of evidence identifying the circumstances in which the relevant communication took place and the topics to which the instructions or advice were directed Kennedy v Wallace 2004 FCAFC 337  2004 142 FCR 185  Kennedy v Wallace  at 189 190 12 17 per Black CJ and

professional discourse in a professional capacity between a solicitor and his client with reference to the transactions covered by his instructions should be regarded as prima facie for the purpose of giving and receiving advice In his Honours view this would apply to any communication that is on its face a communication of a professional nature from the solicitor to the client or his agent touching the subject matter of the solicitors engagement and any communication from the client to the solicitor in connection with that engagement These propositions were referred to with approval by Allsop J in DSE at 5152 and by Branson J in Wenkart v Commissioner of Federal Police unreported Federal Court Branson J 11 November 1996In DSE  Allsop J said that there was no substantive difference between the views expressed in Balabel and Dalleagles  at 51 52 and 71 Allsop J also observed that what underlies the expression of opinion in those cases is the recognition that the obligation of the lawyer to advise once retained is pervasive In his Honours view it would be rare that one could with any degree of confidence say that a communication between client and lawyer in the circumstances of a retainer requiring legal advice and the directing of the client by a legal adviser was not connected with the provision or requesting of legal advice Indeed too literal a requirement of identifying legal advice as express advice about the law would place undue emphasis on formalism and undermine the privilege Rix J as his Lordship then was expressed much the same view in Hellenic Mutual War

arise from the relationship of lawyer and client Waterford v Commonwealth 1987 HCA 25  1987 163 CLR 54 at 96 per Dawson J see also Deane J at 79 82 Some cases have added a requirement that the lawyer

2002 1 Qd R 233 at 245 However in Commonwealth v Vance 2005 158 ACTR 47 the Full Court Gray Connolly and Tamberlin JJ did not regard the possession of a current practising certificate as an essential precondition to the availability of legal professional privilege at 23 35 The same view was taken by Lee J in Candacal at 303 99 by Gillard J in Australian Hospital Care Pindara Pty Ltd v Duggan 1999

to the persons seeking to execute the warrant and if no unprivileged copy or other admissible evidence is made available to prove the contents of the original the otherwise privileged copy loses its protection  12 The Court has power to examine documents over which legal professional privilege is claimed Where there is a disputed claim the High Court has said that the court should not be hesitant to exercise such a power Esso  see also Grant v Downs at 689 If the power is exercised the court will need to recognise that it does not have the benefit of submissions or evidence that might place the document in its proper context The essential purpose of such an inspection is to determine whether on its face the nature and content of the document supports the claim for legal professional

06_1234.xml,c21,cited,Saunders v Commissioner of Australian Federal Police (1998) 160 ALR 469,The general principles that I consider relevant to the disposition of this case can be summarised as follows   1 The party claiming privilege carries the onus of proving that the communication was undertaken or the document was brought into existence for the dominant purpose of giving or obtaining legal advice The onus might be discharged by evidence as to the circumstances and context in which the communications occurred or the documents were brought into existence or by evidence as to the purposes of the person who made the communication or authored the document or procured its creation It might also be discharged by reference to the nature of the documents supported by argument or submissions see Grant v Downs 1976 HCA 63  1976 135 CLR 674  Grant v Downs  at 689 Commissioner of Taxation v Pratt Holdings Pty Ltd 2005 225 ALR 266 at 278 30  FCT v Pratt Holdings  and AWB v Cole at 63 2 The purpose for which a document is brought into existence is a question of fact that must be determined objectively Evidence of the intention of the documents maker or of the person who authorised or procured it is not necessarily conclusive It may be necessary to examine the evidence concerning the purpose of other persons involved in the hierarchy of decisionmaking or consultation that led to the creation of the document and its subsequent communication see AWB v Cole at 110  3 The existence of legal professional privilege is not established merely by the use of verbal formula Grant v Downs at 689 per Stephen Mason and Murphy JJ Nor is a claim of privilege established by mere assertion that privilege applies to particular communications or that communications are undertaken for the purpose of obtaining or giving legal advice National Crime Authority v S 1991 29 FCR 203 at 211 212 per Lockhart J Candacal Pty Ltd v Industry Research  Development Board 2005 223 ALR 284  Candacal  at 298 70 Seven Network Limited v News Limited 2005 FCA 142 at 6 8 If assertions of that kind are received in evidence in support of the privilege claim their conclusionary nature can leave unclear what advice was really being sought There will be cases in which a claim of privilege will not be sustainable in the absence of evidence identifying the circumstances in which the relevant communication took place and the topics to which the instructions or advice were directed Kennedy v Wallace 2004 FCAFC 337  2004 142 FCR 185  Kennedy v Wallace  at 189 190 12 17 per Black CJ and

between a client and his or her independent legal advisers or between a clients inhouse lawyers and those legal advisers it may be appropriate to assume that legitimate legal advice was being sought absent any contrary indications Kennedy v Wallace 2004 208 ALR 424 at 442 65 per Gyles J affirmed on appeal Kennedy v Wallace at 191192 2327 per Black CJ and Emmett J In Kennedy v Wallace  Black CJ and Emmett J inclined to the view that in the ordinary case of a client consulting a lawyer about a legal problem in uncontroversial circumstances proof of those facts alone will provide a sufficient basis for a conclusion that legitimate legal advice is being sought or given  5 A dominant purpose is one that predominates over other purposes it is the prevailing or paramount purpose AWB v Cole at 105106 FCT v Pratt Holdings at 279280 30 per Kenny J 6 An appropriate starting point when applying the dominant purpose test is to ask what was the intended use or uses of the document which accounted for it being brought into existence Pratt Holdings Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation 2004 FCAFC 122  2004 136 FCR 357 at 366 35 per Finn J 7 The concept of legal advice is fairly wide It extends to professional advice as to what a party should prudently or sensibly do in the relevant legal context but it does not extend to advice that is purely commercial or of a public relations character

Commissioner of Australian Federal Police 1998 160 ALR 469 at 472 10 Legal professional privilege is capable of attaching to communications between a salaried legal adviser and his or her employer

Commonwealth v Vance 2005 158 ACTR 47 the Full Court Gray Connolly and Tamberlin JJ did not regard the possession of a current practising certificate as an essential precondition to the availability of legal professional privilege at 23 35 The same view was taken by Lee J in Candacal at 303 99 by Gillard J in Australian Hospital Care Pindara Pty Ltd v Duggan 1999 VSC 131 at 111  and by Downes J in Re McKinnon and Secretary Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade 2004 AATA 1365  2004 86 ALD 780 at 785 51  11 Legal professional privilege protects communications rather than documents as the test for privilege is anchored to the purpose for which the document was brought into existence Consequently legal professional privilege can attach to copies of nonprivileged documents if the purpose of bringing the copy into existence satisfies the dominant purpose test Propend at 507 per Brennan CJ 544 per Gaudron J 553554 per McHugh J 571572 per Gummow J and 587 per Kirby J In Propend at 512 Brennan CJ added a qualification to this principle if an original unprivileged document is not in existence or its location is not disclosed or is not accessible to the persons seeking to execute the warrant and if no unprivileged copy or other admissible evidence is made available to prove the contents of the original the otherwise privileged copy loses its protection  12 The Court has power to examine documents over which legal professional privilege is claimed Where there is a disputed claim the High Court has said that the court should not be hesitant to exercise such a power Esso  see also Grant v Downs at 689 If the power is exercised the court will need to recognise that it does not have the benefit of submissions or evidence that might place the document in its proper context The essential purpose of such an inspection is to determine whether on its face the nature and content of the document supports the claim for legal professional privilege
06_1234.xml,c25,cited,Mitsubishi Electric Australia Pty Ltd v Victoria WorkCover Authority [2002] VSCA 59 ; (2002) 4 VR 332,The Commonwealth contended that AWB had failed in its attempt to prove legal professional privilege because it had not adduced any proof as to AWBs dominant purpose in seeking or obtaining legal advice AWB largely relied upon evidence given by inhouse and external lawyers involved in the particular communications at issue The Commonwealth submitted that evidence proving the lawyers understanding of the purpose of the particular communication and that he or she was giving legal advice affords no evidence of the clients dominant purpose There is no real substance in this criticism Dominant purpose must be determined objectively but it is not uncommon for the relevant purpose to be established by evidence given by the maker of the statement or another person responsible for commissioning the relevant document or bringing it into existence such as a solicitor see Mitsubishi Electric Australia Pty Ltd v Victoria WorkCover Authority 2002 VSCA 59  2002 4 VR 332 at 14  Grant v Downs at 677 and AWB v Cole at 110
06_1234.xml,c26,applied,Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66 ; (1999) 201 CLR 1,The kind of waiver that is in issue in this case is commonly referred to as imputed or implied waiver The former expression is preferable as it reflects the way in which the High Court expressed the governing legal principles in Mann v Carnell 1999 HCA 66  1999 201 CLR 1  Mann In Mann at 13 29 Gleeson CJ Gaudron Gummow and Callinan JJ said   Waiver may be express or implied Disputes as to implied waiver usually arise from the need to decide whether particular conduct is inconsistent with the maintenance of the confidentiality which the privilege is intended to protect When an affirmative answer is given to such a question it is sometimes said that waiver is imputed by operation of law This means that the law recognises the inconsistency and determines its consequences even though such consequences may not reflect the subjective intention of the party who has lost the privilege Thus in Benecke v National Australia Bank  the client was held to have waived privilege by giving evidence in legal proceedings concerning her instructions to a barrister in related proceedings even though she apparently believed she could prevent the barrister from giving the barristers version of those instructions She did not subjectively intend to abandon the privilege She may not even have turned her mind to the question However her intentional act was inconsistent with the maintenance of the confidentiality of the communication What brings about the waiver is the inconsistency which the courts where necessary informed by considerations of fairness perceive between the conduct of the client and maintenance of the confidentiality not some overriding principle of fairness operating at largeThe concluding part of this passage draws attention to the fact that the test for imputed waiver had previously been expressed in terms of fairness see AttorneyGeneral NT v Maurice 1986 HCA 80  1986 161 CLR 475  Maurice  at 481 per Gibbs CJ 487 488 per Mason and Brennan JJ 492 493 per Deane J and 497 498 per Dawson J Under the test propounded in Mann  it is inconsistency between the conduct of the client and the maintenance of the confidentiality that the privilege is intended to protect which effects a waiver of the privilege Fairness has become a subsidiary consideration it may be relevant to the courts assessment of inconsistency in some contexts but not in othersIn Commissioner of Taxation v Rio Tinto Limited 2006 FCAFC 86  Rio Tinto  at 44 the Full Court Kenny Stone and Edmonds JJ said that there was a good deal of doubt whether the language used by the majority in Mann worked any real change in the principle which governs imputed waiver This observation was made somewhat tentatively and was not material to the Courts decision My own view is that a test expressed in terms of inconsistency more readily accommodates the variety of situations in which questions of imputed waiver can arise than a test expressed in terms of fairness The criterion of fairness is readily understandable in the context of inter partes litigation but it is difficult to apply sensibly in other contexts see the observations by McHugh J in Mann at 40 128 and Toohey J in Goldberg v Ng 1995 HCA 39  1995 185 CLR 83  Goldberg v Ng  at 110AWB submitted that this Court should hold that there has been no imputed waiver because the Commonwealth has made no attempt to identify why it would be unfair or inequitable for AWB to maintain privilege in the underlying investigations This submission immediately raises the question unfair or inequitable to whom I doubt that any question arises of fairness to the Commission it is an arm of the executive government charged with the investigation of specified matters Nor does any question arise of fairness to the Commonwealth Fairness presupposes a balancing of interests between parties who are in dispute In that context partial disclosures raise a question of fairness because there is the capacity to mislead one party to the dispute to his or her detriment These concepts do not translate easily to the present case cf McHugh J in Mann at 40 127128 There is also the difficulty that outside the framework of an inter partes dispute fairness is truly a term of indeterminate reference Mann at 40 129 per McHugh J citing RJ Desiatnik Legal Professional Privilege in Australia  1999 p 122 133 Mann anticipated that there will be cases in which considerations of fairness have little or no role to play This is such a case The broad question posed by Mann is whether and to what extent AWBs disclosures are inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality in the documents which are at issue in these proceedings This question wraps up several subsidiary issues in particular whether AWBs disclosures involved on each occasion a disclosure of the gist or substance of its legal advice whether AWB consciously deployed that advice so as to advance its own commercial or other interests and if so whether that disclosure has resulted in an imputed waiver of privilege over any and what associated materials In any application of Mann  the starting point must be an analysis of the disclosures or other acts or omissions of the party claiming privilege that are said to be inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality in the privileged material see Rio Tinto at 45 The disclosures in question here were made variously to the IIC to the Australian Government to the Commission and in some instances via the procedures of the Commission to the public at large In my opinion there is no reason why these disclosures cannot support a finding that AWB has waived legal professional privilege over associated material AWB submitted that imputed waiver cannot arise in the context of a commission established under the RCA Alternatively it submitted that the coercive and inquisitorial context in which the alleged waiver has taken place is an important factor which strongly militates against waiver These submissions ignore the voluntary disclosures that AWB made to the Australian Government In any event I am not persuaded that AWBs disclosures to the Commission and the IIC are incapable of giving rise to an imputed waiver Leaving aside any question of waiver AWB was entitled to maintain legal professional privilege in the course of proceedings before the Commission and by and large it sought to do so To the extent that AWB has already produced documents to the Commission containing legal advice or instructions it did so because it recognised that actions it had taken outside the Commission had the consequence of waiving privilege over those documents As for the oral evidence that the Commonwealth now relies upon Lindberg Cooper and Scales were senior executives of AWB when they gave that evidence to the Commission There is nothing before me to suggest that they were not speaking as executives of AWB when they gave their evidence or that their evidence fell outside the scope of their authority from AWB Further their evidence was given in the presence of AWBs legal representatives without any objection being raised on grounds of legal professional privilege Lindberg Cooper and Scales may have been compelled to give evidence at the Commission but they were under no compulsion to reveal the gist or substance of legal advice that had been obtained by AWB In these circumstances I infer that the relevant evidence given by Lindberg Cooper and Scales was given with the authority or acquiescence of AWB I also infer that AWB was content for the evidence to be given at public hearings of the Commission having regard to its own commercial interests The evidence before me makes it clear that AWB was concerned to defend its integrity and commercial reputation in the course of the Commissions hearings I infer that AWB made the assessment that it would advance its commercial interests if it were to be known publicly that it had undertaken extensive legal reviews and that as a result it had obtained legal advice that there was no evidence that it had engaged in any improper or unlawful conduct in breach of the United Nations sanctions AWB was content for information of this character to be disclosed publicly in relation to both Project Rose and Project Water It would of course be a different case if the documents and information that the Commonwealth relies upon were disclosed under legal compulsion On any view the fact that documents and information were disclosed under compulsion would be very relevant to the question whether the person claiming privilege had engaged in inconsistent conduct There is moreover authority to the effect that a production of documents or evidence under compulsion will not result in any waiver of privilege Goldman v Hesper 1988 1 WLR 1238  Goldman  Trans America Computer Co Inc v IBM Corporation 573 F2d 646 9 th Cir 1978  Trans America  at 651 AWBs disclosures to the IIC were not made under legal compulsion They were made by choice under a confidentiality regime negotiated by AWB The Memorandum of Understanding between AWB and the IIC provided that AWB could withhold documents from the IIC on grounds of commercial sensitivity or legal professional privilege or if there was a risk that AWB its officers or employees would be exposed to breaches of Australian law It also provided that any interviews conducted by the IIC of AWB officers or employees could be undertaken in the presence of a personal legal counsel andor up to two representatives of AWB AWB thereby retained the right to object to any question that intruded into areas protected by legal professional privilege On the evidence before me including in particular the various briefings which Hargreaves gave to the Australian Government it is clear that AWB decided that it needed to cooperate and be seen to cooperate with the IIC so as to retain the support of the Australian Government and to protect and defend its commercial reputation I do not agree with AWBs submission that even if its disclosures were not compelled by law the inquisitorial context in which they took place is a factor which strongly militates against waiver In Australia legal professional privilege is a fundamental common law right that can be asserted outside the context of adversarial litigation It can for instance be invoked to resist the production of documents in answer to a search warrant or the giving of information or the production of documents pursuant to coercive statutory powers or notices Daniels at 552553 9 11 and 563 44 Baker v Campbell 1983 HCA 39  1983 153 CLR 52 As legal professional privilege can be invoked outside the context of judicial or quasijudicial proceedings logic suggests that it should be capable of being waived if the claimant engages in conduct that is inconsistent with the maintenance of the confidentiality that the privilege is intended to protect It should not matter whether the conduct takes place within or outside the framework of the proceedings or investigatory process in which a demand has been made for the production of privileged documents or information The crucial question is whether the conduct is inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality The disclosure of privileged communications to a third party can result in an imputed waiver of privilege even if there is no intention of waiving privilege and the disclosure is for a limited and specific purpose In Mann  the Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory conveyed legal advice on a confidential basis to a member of the Territorys Legislative Assembly to enable him to consider the reasonableness of the Governments decision to settle certain legal proceedings The majority decision turned on the fact that the disclosure to a member of the Legislative Assembly was not regarded as disclosure to a third party In their joint judgment Gleeson CJ Gaudron Gummow and Callinan JJ said at 15 35 that   The purpose of the privilege being to protect the Territory from subsequent disclosure of the legal advice it received concerning the litigation instituted by the appellant there was nothing inconsistent with that purpose in the Chief Minister conveying the terms of that advice on a confidential basis to a member of the Legislative Assembly who wished to consider the reasonableness of the conduct of the Territory in relation to the litigation  However their Honours also observed that while the voluntary disclosure of privileged legal advice to a third party will not necessarily waive privilege it can do so They said that Goldberg v Ng illustrates that depending on the circumstances the disclosure of a privileged communication to a third party for a limited and specific purpose and on terms as to confidentiality can have the consequence of waiving privilege   McHugh J dissented In his view any disclosure of privileged material to a third party who is a stranger to the privileged relationship ie to a person who is not the lawyer or the client should have the consequence that privilege in that material is waived as against the world at 34 108 3738 118 42 133134 As I read his Honours judgment the key reason why his Honour preferred a bright line rule of this kind is that it would ensure that legal professional privilege was not extended beyond the rationales that support it at 37 117118   Ensuring candid communications between a lawyer and a client is unlikely to be endangered if a privilege holder is held to waive privilege because he or she has voluntarily disclosed the communication to a stranger Whether the communication will be disclosed in the future to a stranger to the privilege is entirely within the control of the client At that stage the client will determine whether his or her interests are best served by retaining the privilege or disclosing the communication But it is difficult to see how the possibility of voluntary disclosure will prevent the client being candid with his or her lawyer    A client who voluntarily discloses privileged information to a stranger to the privileged relationship has made a choice based no doubt on considerations personal to him or her that the purpose for which the communication is disclosed to the stranger is more important than protecting the absolute confidentiality of the communication by preventing the stranger from having knowledge of it The person may be encouraged to do so as in Goldberg v Ng  by an expectation that the stranger will not further disclose the communication But in my opinion if privileged material is voluntarily disclosed to a stranger to the privileged relationship the fact that it may be received under an obligation of confidence should not be relevant to whether privileged is waived  On the facts McHugh J considered that disclosure to a member of the Legislative Assembly who was not a member of the Executive Government was relevantly a disclosure to a stranger to the privileged relationship at 44 139  In Goldberg v Ng  the respondents sued their solicitor Goldberg for failure to account for monies received and disbursed by him as their solicitor They also made a professional conduct complaint against him to the Law Society of New South Wales In answer to the complaint Goldberg prepared statements with annexures that included a draft brief to counsel and submitted them to the Societys professional conduct department In doing so Goldberg told the Society that the statements and the annexures were confidential and he wished to retain his legal professional privilege in them The Society dismissed the complaint on the ground that there was no evidence of professional misconduct or unsatisfactory professional conduct Subsequently in the course of the Supreme Court proceedings instituted by the respondents against Goldberg the respondents served a subpoena on the Society requiring it to produce documents relating to the complaint against Goldberg All of the members of the High Court held that there had been no express or intentional waiver by Goldberg of his legal professional privilege in the statements and annexures The issue that divided the Court was whether waiver should be imputed by operation of law Deane Dawson and Gaudron JJ held at 100102 that it should because the professional complaint and the Supreme Court proceedings were but different emanations of the one dispute and Goldbergs provision of the statements to the Society was voluntary and for the calculated purpose of demonstrating the reliability of his denial of the alleged failure to account Their Honours analysed the issue in terms of fairness but they could equally and perhaps more appropriately have done so in terms of inconsistency Toohey and Gummow JJ dissented in separate judgments Each expressed the view that waiver should not be imputed because the disclosures by Goldberg were made to a third party for a limited and specific purpose Toohey J said at 110 that the following factors militated strongly against any implied or imputed waiver first Goldberg disclosed material to the Society because of a complaint against him on an undertaking by the Society that the contents would be kept confidential secondly the disclosure was made in the context of the Societys investigation of a complaint in pursuance of its statutory powers and consequently it could be regarded as having been made for the purposes of the Act and thirdly the disclosure was confined to the Society Gummow J said at 123 that as the disclosures were made in the context of compulsory statutory processes the circumstances of the case supplied no sufficient reason for depriving Goldberg of privilege even allowing for the advantage he sought to gain by making the disclosure The case of Restom v Battenberg 2006 FCA 781 provides an example of a case where disclosures to a third party triggered a waiver of legal professional privilege In the course of bankruptcy proceedings the debtor claimed privilege over a letter that passed between his Australian and Scottish solicitors Stone J held that the disclosure of the contents of the letter to the Scottish Employment Tribunal was inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality in the letter and constituted a waiver of privilege In Network Ten Ltd v Capital Television Holdings Ltd 1995 36 NSWLR 275 which predated Goldberg v Ng and Mann  Giles J held that a limited and specific disclosure of privileged material on terms of confidentiality did not result in a loss of privilege In Australian Rugby Union Ltd v Hospitality Group Pty Ltd 1999 165 ALR 253 Sackville J said that it follows from Goldberg v Ng that the disclosure of a privileged communication for a limited purpose and subject to a confidentiality requirement may or may not amount to a waiver of privilege depending on the circumstances of the case at 262263 4243 On the facts of that case Sackville J held that a disclosure of legal advice to the solicitors and representatives of two other companies on strict terms as to confidentiality and for the purpose of those other companies obtaining legal advice did not result in an imputed waiver His Honour distinguished Goldberg v Ng as a case in which the disclosure was made to gain an advantage over the opposing party in related litigation at 263 45 There are several English cases in which disclosure to a third party for a limited and specific purpose has not resulted in a loss of privilege British Coal Corporation v Dennis Rye Ltd No 2 1988 1 WLR 1113  British Coal  Goldman  and Gotha City v Southebys No 1 1988 1 WLR 1114 In British Coal  Neill LJ with whom Stocker LJ and Dillon LJ agreed held that the disclosure of documents by the plaintiff to the police to assist in a criminal investigation and criminal trial did not constitute a waiver of the privilege Neill LJ said at 822   In my judgment the action of the plaintiff in making documents available for the purpose of the criminal trial did not constitute a waiver of the privilege to which it was entitled in the present civil proceedings Its action in regard to both the category A and the category B documents was in accordance with its duty to assist in the conduct of the criminal proceedings and could not properly be construed as an express or implied waiver of its rights in its own civil litigation Indeed it would in my view be contrary to public policy if the plaintiffs action in making the documents available in the criminal proceedings had the effect of automatically removing the cloak of privilege which would otherwise be available to them in the civil litigation for which the cloak was designed    In Goldman  the Court of Appeal considered the effect of a statutory requirement that a claimant for costs must disclose privileged materials to the Courts taxing officers Taylor LJ with whom Woolf LJ and Lord Donaldson MR agreed said that once a party puts forward privileged documents as part of his case for costs the privilege is relaxed temporarily and pro hac vice  If the taxing officers felt compelled by natural justice considerations to disclose part or all of the contents of a privileged document to the opposite party that disclosure would be for the purposes of the taxation only and would not amount to a waiver that prevented the owner of the document from reasserting privilege in any subsequent context at 102 McHugh J took a stricter view in Giannarelli v Wraith No 2 1991 HCA 2  1991 171 CLR 592 His Honour noted that in Victoria unlike in England a litigant can refuse to produce documents to the taxing master on the grounds of legal professional privilege However McHugh J said that if the litigant choses to produce privileged documents to the taxing master then the litigant will be taken to have waived privilege and must let the opposing parties see the documents His Honour did not countenance any middle course under which privilege could be waived solely for the purposes of the taxation and then reasserted in some other context at 607 The general rule adopted in the United States is that any voluntary disclosure of privileged communications by a client to a third party breaches the confidentiality of the attorneyclient relationship and therefore waives the privilege not only as to the specific communication disclosed but as to all other communications relating to the same subject matter see Weil v InvestmentIndicators Research and Management Inc 647 F2d 18 9 th Cir 1981 at 24 United States v Aronoff 466 FSupp 855 DC NY 1979 at 862 910 In re Sealed Case 676 F2d 793 DC

NY 1987 and T Harman Fairness and the Doctrine of Subject Matter Waiver of the AttorneyClient Privilege in Extrajudicial Disclosure Situations 1988 University of Illinois Law Review 999 The US courts have also considered whether a disclosure of privileged material to government investigators will have the consequence of waiving privilege In re Sealed Case  the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia considered whether a corporation that had submitted its own investigating counsels report into alleged bribes and improper payments to the Internal Revenue Service and the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC pursuant to voluntary disclosure programs had thereby impliedly waived its privilege over documents which were clearly identified in the report The Court held that by revealing part of privileged communications to the agencies to gain a commercial advantage the corporation had made a disclosure which was inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality Accordingly the Court held that the corporation had waived privilege as to all other communications relating to the same subject matter The principle applied by the Court was that at 818 29   Courts need not allow a claim of privilege when the party claiming the privilege seeks to use it in a way that is not consistent with the purpose of the privilege Thus since the purpose of the attorneyclient privilege is to protect the confidentiality of attorneyclient communications in order to foster candor within the attorneyclient relationship voluntary breach of confidence or selective disclosure for tactical purposes waives the privilege Disclosure is inconsistent with confidentiality and courts need not permit hideandseek manipulation of confidences in order to foster candor    The Court rejected an argument that waiver should not be imputed because the corporation had disclosed the investigating counsels report for specific and limited purposes only In doing so it declined to follow the decision in Diversified Industries Inc v Meredith 572 F2d 596 8 th Cir 1977  Diversified Industries  at 611 in which the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals held that disclosures to the SEC under a voluntary disclosure program did not constitute a waiver to anyone but the SEC It noted that the decision in Diversified Industries was rejected in Permian Corp v United States 665 F2d 1215 DC Cir 1981 at 12201222 on the ground that it unnecessarily expanded the scope of attorneyclient privilege see also In re Weiss 596 F2d 1185 4 th Cir 1979 at 1186 Like the District Columbia Circuit the First

produced to a government regulator under compulsion of law Putting to one side its provision of Mr Tracey QCs advices and instructions and its briefings to the Australian Government AWB disputed that the disclosures it made to the IIC and the Commission disclosed the gist or substance of legal advice that AWB obtained as a result of Project Rose or Project Water It contended that these disclosures did no more than refer to the existence of legal advice without disclosing its substance Alternatively AWB argued that the record of Lindbergs interview with the IIC and the evidence given to the Commission by Lindberg Cooper and Scales cannot be related to any particular piece of legal advice other than that provided by Mr Tracey QC The applicable principles are set out in my decision in AWB v Cole at 135 139 The authorities draw a distinction between a mere reference to the existence of legal advice which will not usually amount to a waiver and cases in which the gist or substance of the legal advice has been disclosed see Maurice at 481 488 and 493 Ampolex Ltd v Perpetual Trustee Co Canberra Ltd 1996 HCA 15  1996 70 ALJR 603 at 607 Ampolex Ltd v Perpetual Trustee Co Canberra Ltd 1996

or stance that a lawyer had advised a client to take was not inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality in the communication giving the advice The trial judge also appeared to draw a distinction between statements which disclose the conclusion or logical result of legal advice and statements which disclose the content of the legal advice and its reasoning see Tamberlin J at 105 10 and Gyles J at 118 61 The Full Court rejected this approach Gyles J stated at 119 65 that the voluntary disclosure of the gist or conclusion of the legal advice amounts to waiver in respect of the whole of the advice to which reference is made including the reasons for the conclusion Tamberlin J said at 104 6   In my view it would be inconsistent and unfair having disclosed and used the substance of the advice in this way to now seek to maintain privilege in respect of the relevant parts of that advice which pertain to the expressed conclusion It may perhaps have been different if it had been simply asserted that the client has taken legal advice and that the position which was adopted having considered the advice is that certain action will be taken or not taken In those circumstances the substance of the advice is not disclosed but merely the fact that there was some advice and that it was considered However once the conclusion in the advice is stated together with the effect of it then in my view there is imputed waiver of the privilege The whole point of an advice is the final conclusion This is the situation in this case    Subsequently Tamberlin J was confronted with a case that was very similar to the one he hypothesised in Bennett  In Nine Films and Television Pty Ltd v NINOX Television Ltd 2005 65 IPR 442 the applicant contended that the respondents had waived privilege in various legal advices because of the way in which the respondents had publicly referred to the advice Tamberlin J held that there had been no waiver He concluded that the mere assertion that advice had been taken and the fact that action is then taken by the client is not sufficient unless the two are linked in such a way that it is apparent that the advice is that specified action should be taken His Honour also made the following observations at 446447 26   Whilst I accept that in some circumstances a clear disclosure of the bottom line of the advice and the course of conduct taken thereafter may be sufficient to amount to waiver of legal professional privilege I do not think these matters have been established in the present case On a fair and reasonable reading the statement to the effect that senior counsel had been engaged and that he had reviewed matters in detail and that steps were being taken based on his recommendations is not sufficient to amount to a waiver of the legal advice The substance or content of the advice is not disclosed with specificity or clarity Questions of waiver are matters of fact and degree and in this instance I am not persuaded that the conduct assertions or admissible evidence are sufficient to warrant the necessary implication that legal professional privilege has been waived    The principles discussed in Bennett were applied in Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd No 12  2006 FCA 348 The issue was whether a statement in a discovered document that our legal advice is that the risk of damages being awarded against Optus is low had the consequence of waiving privilege in the legal advice that it referred to Sackville J held that it did the statement voluntarily disclosed the gist or conclusion of the legal advice at 12 In Rio Tinto Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation 2005 224 ALR 299 the Commissioner of Taxation filed particulars with the Court stating that the Commissioner would be relying on specified grounds which have been confirmed by Senior Tax Counsel and supported by AGS and opinions obtained from counsel The taxpayer contended that the Commissioner had thereby waived privilege in the legal advice of the Australian Government Solicitor and the opinions of counsel Sundberg J held that these references voluntarily disclosed the conclusion or substance of the advice and consequently privilege had been waived Sundberg Js decision went on appeal to the Full Court but the Full Courts decision turned on the alternative ground of issue waiver Rio Tinto at 72 The Full

06_1236.xml,c1,applied,Drake v Minister for Immigration & Ethnic Affairs (1979) 46 FLR 409,The first ground of appeal agitated in the Authoritys written and oral submissions focused on the cancellation decision It was common ground that in relation to the review of the decision to cancel the respondents registration the question for the Tribunal was whether that decision was the correct or preferable decision Drake v Minister for Immigration  Ethnic Affairs 1979 46 FLR 409 at 419 per Bowen CJ and Deane J that is whether it was the correct or preferable decision to conclude that the respondent was not a person of integrity or was otherwise not a fit and proper person to give immigration assistanceThe primary issue raised by this ground was whether the Tribunal asked itself this question in relation to the correct point in time The Authority submitted that the Tribunal did not consider whether on 14 July 2003 the date of the Authoritys decision the correct or preferable decision was to cancel the respondents registration rather the question which the Tribunal asked itself was whether on 2 September 2005 the date of the Tribunals decision the respondent was not a person of integrity or was otherwise not a fit and proper person to give immigration assistance
06_1236.xml,c2,applied,"Freeman v Secretary, Department of Social Security (1988) 19 FCR 342",The Authority submitted that there is a clear line of authority that in cancellation cases such as the present a review Tribunal is required to have regard to the circumstances at the time of the decision and not those that followed it Freeman v Secretary Department of Social Security 1988 19 FCR 342 Hospital Benefit Fund of WA v Minister for Health Housing and Community Services 1992 39 FCR 225 Nong v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs 2000 FCA 1575  2000 106 FCR 257 Minister for

respondent submitted that the clear line of authority referred to by the Authority beginning with the decision of Davies J in Freeman  in support of the submission that the correct point in time is the time of the decision under review is not directly relevant to the present question and can be distinguished because those authorities relate to different legislative provisionsThe respondent analysed the reasoning of the Court in Freeman  That case it was said is commonly cited as authority for the proposition that the relevant point in time at which the Tribunal is to determine a persons entitlement will differ depending upon whether the decision under review was a decision refusing to grant an entitlement or whether it was one cancelling an existing entitlement Where the decision is to refuse an entitlement the point in time is the date of the Tribunals decision and where the decision is to cancel an entitlement the Tribunal is limited to considering the state of affairs as it existed on the date of the decision under reviewThe respondent submitted that critical to the Courts reasoning in Freeman was that in that case the Tribunal had affirmed the decision under review to cancel the applicants pension This meant that no further matter remained for the Tribunals consideration at 345 and any entitlement of the applicant for a further pension would only revive when a fresh application for a pension had been made at 345 346The respondent submitted that Freeman should not be taken as authority for any general principle that administrative decisions may be categorized either as cancellation decisions or refusal decisions to which vastly different regimes of review are applicable If it does then it was respectfully submitted that it was wrong and should not be followed It was submitted that any attempt to apply such a universal categorisation to cancellations and refusals merely distracts from the primary question which is to identify the issues required under the particular legislationThe question here according to the respondent should therefore focus on whether s 3031f itself fixes a point in timeThe respondent submitted that there is nothing in s 3031f of the Act to suggest that the point in time for the determination of the fitness and integrity issue is to be limited to the date of the Authoritys decision and that the Tribunal is not entitled to take account of developments which have occurred up until the date of the Tribunals decision The respondent said Indeed a consideration of the provision suggests that the point in time should be the situation as it has developed by the time of the Tribunals decisionThe respondent pointed out that the present case was of course factually different from Freeman in that here the Tribunal set aside the Authoritys decision to cancel the respondents registration and substituted it with a decision to caution the respondent subject to conditions whereas in Freeman the Tribunal had affirmed the decision to cancel the applicants pension so that no further matter remained for the Tribunals consideration  In Freeman therefore any entitlement of the applicant for a further pension would revive only when a fresh application for a pension had been made Here the decision had been set aside ab initio  so that the parties were placed in the position that they would have occupied had the decision never been made so that the respondent had the benefit of the extant decision granting him registration See Secretary Department of Social Security v OConnell 1992 38 FCR 540 549 550 The Tribunal therefore remained a part of the continuum of the administrative decisionmaking process and there was no impediment to it determining what were the appropriate orders to be made as at the date of the Tribunals decisionThe respondent submitted that the only specific complaint made by the Authority as to irrelevant evidence taken into account by the Tribunal related to the respondents current practice and his current success rate When considered in the context of all the evidence before the Tribunal both of these pieces of evidence were relevant either because they related to events that occurred before the cancellation decision or they were afteracquired evidence The respondent submitted that on any view of s 3031f  the Tribunal was therefore entitled to take account of the evidence referred to as the respondents current practice and his current success rate in relation to the cancellation decisionIn addition the respondent submitted that whether or not the Tribunal was entitled to take the afteracquired evidence into account in relation to the cancellation decision it was undoubtedly required to take it into account in relation to the suspension decision and the two refusal decisions On the Authoritys case and the authority of Freeman  the point in time for those decisions would have been the date of the Tribunals decision Given that the Tribunal gave a joint decision on all four decisions under review it was not possible for the Authority to establish with any degree of probability that the evidence of the respondents current practice and his current success rate was necessarily taken into account in relation to the cancellation decisionThe respondent noted that at no time during the Tribunals hearing did the Authority object to the reception of the evidence relating to respondents current practice and his current success rate It was put that this may be relevant to the issue of costs should the Authority succeed in this appealThe Authority submitted that in Freeman the issue for determination by the Tribunal was whether the decision to cancel on the date of the original cancellation was the correct or preferable decision not whether the applicant was entitled to a benefit at the time of the Tribunals decision The Authority submitted that that is the same in this case The question for the Tribunal was whether its cancellation decision in July 2003 was the correct or preferable decision not whether the respondent might be eligible to be registered in September 2005In Freeman  Davies J indicated that it is important to have regard to the nature of the decision The distinction his Honour saw as critical was between a decision to refuse to grant a pension or benefit where there was an ongoing entitlement which can be seen as part of a continuum and a decision to cancel a pension made on a particular date A decision of this kind has no ongoing nature once made it is spentDavies J noted that under the Social Security Act 1947 Cth once a benefit is cancelled it may only be paid again following a fresh application That is also the position in the present legislative context Where a migration agent has had his registration cancelled he would need to apply for registration afresh and cannot make such an application for five years s 292 In this sense the present case is even stronger than that considered by Davies J in Freeman Davies J noted that a further distinction between entitlement decisions and cancellation decisions is that in the former case but not the latter the Tribunal can decide entitlement throughout the relevant continuum up to its decision This is not possible in cancellation cases because if the cancellation decision was correct or preferable there is no further step That is also the position here and probably in all cancellation casesThe Authority noted that the respondent had sought to distinguish this case on the basis that the legislation is different However the Authority argued no material difference was identified The only difference is the one noted above and it tends to show that this case is even more clear cut than that in Freeman It was also observed that the power to cancel pensions in the Social Security Act was not restricted to being exercised at some point in time This it was said was not part of Davies Js analysis contrary to the respondents submissionsThe Authority noted that the Full Court in Hospital Benefit Fund of WA v Minister for Health Housing and Community Affairs approved the analysis of Davies J in Freeman at 2345 In that case the legislation tied the primary decisionmaker to a small period of time after certain rule changes were notified The Court found that the Tribunal faced the same question as the primary decisionmaker which required it to look at the time the original decision should have been made The legislation in that case is different from that in the present However the Authority submitted the core principle is that the Tribunal must answer the same question as was answered by the primary decisionmaker For the reasons given by Davies J in Freeman  in a cancellation case that involves whether the decision to cancel on the actual date of the cancellation was the correct or preferable decisionThe Authority observed that this analysis was also endorsed and applied by Weinberg J in Sharma at 524 526 61 63 and in the context of review of a decision to cancel a visa under the Act by Katz J in Nong albeit through reference to Weinberg J in Sharma  who applied Freeman  at 29 31   29 As I understood the submission at least in the form in which it appeared in Mr Nongs written outline of submissions filed in advance of the hearing before me it was that the MRT had erred in not concluding that on 6 January 2000 the date of its decision Mr Nong was in compliance with condition 8202   30 That submission may be dealt with quite briefly   31 The MRT was not concerned in making its decision with the issue whether Mr Nong was or was not in compliance with condition 8202 on 6 January 2000 the date of its own decision Rather it was concerned with the issue whether Mr Nong had or had not been in compliance with condition 8202 on 30 March 1999 the date of the delegates decision see for example the discussion of the nature of the review function of the MRTs predecessor in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Sharma 1999 FCA 31  1999 90 FCR 513 at 524526 61  63 Weinberg J Emphasis addedThe Authority observed that in Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency  Branson J considered that only limited assistance was gained from categorising decisions as cancellation decisions or entitlements decisions at 26 Her Honour considered that it was necessary to consider the nature of the decision involved In that case the Tribunal was to review a decision to vary the period of accreditation for an aged care provider this decision did not fit readily into the cancellation entitlement dichotomy Her Honour considered that in the legislation before her the fact that a decision could be made only after an audit report was obtained and only within 14 days of receipt of that report was important However her Honour also applied the reasoning of Davies J in Freeman in concluding that the decision was not part of an administrative continuum Her Honour also observed at 30 31   30  In my view the Tribunal would be undertaking a quite different process from that which the Principles required the accreditation body to undertake were it to review a decision made under s 324 by reference to factual material remote in time from the review audit report In particular I consider that on review of a decision made under s 324 it is not open to the approved provider to seek to undermine the significance of the review audit report and the recommendations included in it by calling evidence of improvements in its practice and procedure implemented after the date of the decision and in response to the review audit report and recommendations   31 I conclude that the Tribunal would not be addressing the same questions as the applicant was required to address if it were to determine whether at the time of the Tribunals decision the decision of the applicant under s 324 of the Principles can be seen to be the correct or preferable decision This is not to say that the Tribunal cannot receive evidence of facts that occurred after the date of the decision under review However to be relevant to the Tribunals decision that evidence must in my view bear on the merits of the decision as at the time that it was required to be madeIn summary the Authority submitted by way of reply that   1 Applying the principles stated in Freeman  the review of a decision to cancel a migration agents registration on a particular date involves a determination of whether that decision was the correct or preferable decision at that date  2 Where a decision is made to cancel say because an agent does not have the necessary ambit of knowledge of migration procedures at the time of the decision as shown by a track record of failings in this regard a review applicant cannot show that that was not the correct or preferable decision by acquiring the relevant knowledge thereafter If the person has become eligible he or she may then be able to apply for registration afresh  3 Similarly where a decision is made to cancel because of massive and serious violations of the Code of Conduct it would be absurd if a review applicant could seek to rely upon compliance with the Code after the date of the decision Compliance achieved by enforcement proceedings is not what the legislation is designed to achieve Agents are required to comply with the legislation when registered  4 For these reasons and the reasons outlined above this Court should follow Freeman and the cases that have applied it and conclude that the question before the Tribunal in relation to the cancellation decision was whether the decision to cancel on 14 July 2003 was the correct or preferable decision having regard to the circumstances pertaining up to that time  5 The respondent argued that it would be against the policy of the Act if the Tribunal were not permitted to have regard to events following the cancellation decision He suggests there is no reason why the Tribunal should not find that it has become satisfied of s 3031e if an agent becomes bankrupt during the review processes The Authority says that this reasoning is flawed and not necessary A later bankruptcy does not indicate that any earlier decision to cancel because of lack of integrity was the correct or preferable decision It is irrelevant to that question or without more would be The Authority could of course cancel the registration afresh on the basis of the bankruptcy when it becomes aware that that has happened A person whose registration was wrongfully cancelled should not have it affirmed simply because a reason to cancel it subsequently arises There is also a fresh power to cancel when a proper reason arises Likewise a person whose cancellation was correct or preferable should not be able to avoid that proper consequence because of actions taken after the decision to rectify perceived deficiencies  6 Contrary to the respondents submission no part of the Authoritys argument requires the notion of fitness or character to be narrowly construed However success rates in late 2003 and 2004 simply have no bearing on the respondents fitness before that time nor does any absence of subsequent breaches of the Code  7 It may be accepted that evidence of character after the date of the decision could be relevant because character has been held to involve the enduring moral qualities of a person So for example evidence that a person has lied or not been frank in their evidence after the date of the decision would be relevant not directly as breaches of a rule requiring honesty but as an indicia of a persons enduring moral qualities An inference would be available that an adult prepared to lie to or mislead the Tribunal or just not be frank at its hearing had the same moral qualities at the time of the decision However this reasoning does not mean that evidence relating to every criteria post the cancellation decision is relevant For example evidence that an agent has knowledge in 2004 simply does not show that he had that knowledge in 2003  8 The respondents reliance upon PekoWallsend is misconceived The Authority does not say that the Tribunal may not have regard to the most up to date evidence at hand However it has to be evidence that is relevant to the question at hand the position in July 2003  9 Contrary to the respondents submission the absence of a time limit for the making of a decision to cancel does not have the result that the Tribunal is required to make its decision on the basis of all evidence up to the time of its decision Freeman  Nong   10 The respondent seeks to get some assistance from extrinsic materials It is said that his construction is consistent with the object stated in the passage quoted However without conceding that this is a proper use of extrinsic materials it may be answered by noting that the Authoritys construction is also consistent with that object  11 Contrary to the respondents submission it would not be inimical to the achievement of the objects of the provisions if the Tribunal could not have regard to adverse developments that happened after the making of the decision under review The Authority would be having regard to such conduct and is ideally placed to take appropriate action even if a review is pending in relation to an earlier decision indeed this happened in this very case when the respondents registration was suspended while the cancellation review was pending  12 It would however be inimical to the achievement of the objects if agents who have been cancelled for failing to comply with the Code of Conduct or failing to maintain necessary knowledge can avoid that legislated consequence by relying upon subsequent improved conduct and subsequent compliance A system of this kind is less likely to be effective in ensuring that agents comply at all times if there is a perception that the consequences of breaches can be avoided  13 The respondents submissions at 34 supra misconceive Davies Js reasons in Freeman  They did not turn upon the fact that the Tribunal had affirmed the cancellation decision but upon the nature of the decision under review The respondents argument is some kind of bootstraps argument The Tribunals decision is being challenged because it failed to appreciate the nature of its task That task does not have a different nature according to the conclusion it reaches at the end of the task  14 The respondent submitted that all the evidence relied upon by the Tribunal in addressing the question it answered as at September 2005 would have been available if it had asked itself the correct question as at July 2003 This is said to support a futility argument This Court should not accept the proposition that the Tribunals error it is implicitly admitted by the respondent that it did answer the question as at September 2005 and on the Authoritys submissions as to law this would be an error of law could not have made a difference  15 First some of the evidence was not relevant to 14 July 2003    a Is this form of file note taking  does this represent approximately what your current practice would be with taking files notes Yes   AB 550 b Is that representative of your current practice in relation to client agreements AB 551 c Mr Shi do you now keep copies or is it your practice to keep copies of letters on file to your clients Yes yes AB 5553  d The evidence of his success rate from the beginning of 2003 until August 2004 presented in a form that did not disclose that rate as at July 2003 AB 566 567 575 576 803 775 776    16 In any event even if the evidence were all relevant it may have been weighted differently if the correct question were asked The Court should remit the matter to the Tribunal if it finds that the Tribunal misunderstood its task  17 As the Tribunal dealt with all four review decisions together the Court cannot be sure that the Tribunal did not have regard to the later evidence only in relation to the decisions of later dates The point is however that the Tribunal dealt with them all together when it needed to separate the decision according to their nature and the evidence that was relevant to each The fact that it did not do this proves the Authoritys case rather than the reverseAfter having considered the relevant provisions of the Act the authorities to which I was referred and the respective submissions of the parties I have concluded that the clear line of authority beginning with the decision of Davies J in Freeman  upon which the Authority relies does govern the position in relation to the cancellation decision and that the question which the Tribunal had to ask itself was whether on 14 July 2003 the correct or preferable decision was to cancel the respondents registration in other words the question which the Tribunal had to ask itself was whether as at that date the respondent was not a person of integrity or was otherwise not a fit and proper person to give immigration assistanceI am of the view that the Tribunal did not ask itself this question Rather it asked itself whether at the time of its decision the respondent was not a person of integrity or was otherwise not a fit and proper person to give immigration assistanceI am impelled to the view that the Tribunal asked itself the wrong question by reference to the Tribunals 2 September 2005

06_1236.xml,c3,referred_to,"Hospital Benefit Fund of WA v Minister for Health, Housing and Community Affairs (1992) 39 FCR 225",The Authority submitted that there is a clear line of authority that in cancellation cases such as the present a review Tribunal is required to have regard to the circumstances at the time of the decision and not those that followed it Freeman v Secretary Department of Social Security 1988 19 FCR 342 Hospital Benefit Fund of WA v Minister for Health Housing and Community Services 1992 39 FCR 225 Nong v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs 2000 FCA 1575  2000 106 FCR 257 Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Sharma 1999 FCA 31  1999 90 FCR 513 and Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency Ltd v Kenna Investments Pty Ltd 2004 FCA 843  2004 138 FCR 428The Authority noted that the Full Court in Hospital Benefit Fund of WA v Minister for Health Housing and Community Affairs approved the analysis of Davies J in Freeman at 2345 In that case the legislation tied the primary decisionmaker to a small period of time after certain rule changes were notified The Court found that the Tribunal faced the same question as the primary decisionmaker which required it to look at the time the original decision should have been made The legislation in that case is different from that in the present However the Authority submitted the core principle is that the Tribunal must answer the same question as was answered by the primary decisionmaker For the reasons given by Davies J in Freeman  in a cancellation case that involves whether the decision to cancel on the actual date of the cancellation was the correct or preferable decision
06_1236.xml,c4,applied,Lu v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 340 ; (2004) 141 FCR 346,The respondent submitted that notwithstanding these findings the Court should exercise its discretion to decline to grant the appeal because it would be futile to remit the matter for redetermination The basis for this submission was that all of the matters taken into account by the Tribunal were open for it to consider either because they predated the decision under review or because they were afteracquired evidence As such any technical error in identifying the correct point in time would not have materially affected the Tribunals decision Lu v Minister for Immigration  Multicultural  Indigenous Affairs 2004 FCAFC 340  2004 141 FCR 346 at 62 64 per Sackville JI cannot agree with this submission First I do not accept that all the evidence relied upon by the Tribunal in addressing the question it answered as at September 2005 would have been available if it had asked the correct question as at July 2003 Some of the evidence was not relevant to 14 July 2003 Examples of that are to be found at 4715 supra In any event as the Authority submitted 4716 supra even if the evidence was all relevant it may have been weighted differently if the correct question were askedSecond as Sackville J observed in Lu at 64 the correct approach is that stated in Stead v State Government Insurance Commission 1986 HCA 54  1986 161 CLR 141 at 147 and adopted in Re Refugee Review Tribunal Ex parte Aala 2000 HCA 57  2000 204 CLR 82 the test is whether the applicant could have been deprived of the possibility of a successful outcome by the decisionmakers failure to observe the requirements of the statute If so the jurisdictional error could have had a bearing on the outcome and the applicant is not to be denied relief on the basis that the error was insignificant  The question is not whether the decisionmaker would probably have realised the same result even if the  consideration had not been taken into account
06_1236.xml,c5,referred_to,Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24,Such an interpretation was it was submitted no more than an application of the general principle referred to in Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v PekoWallsend 1986 HCA 40  1986 162 CLR 24 at 45 per Mason J Gibbs CJ and Dawson J agreeing that    an administrative decisionmaker is required to make his decision on the basis of material available to him at the time the decision is made  which is itself a reflection of the fact that there may be found in the subjectmatter scope and purpose of nearly every statute conferring power to make an administrative decision an implication that the decision is to be made on the basis of the most current material available to the decisionmakerAs was said by Mason J in PekoWallsend at 45   It would be a strange result indeed to hold that the  decisionmaker is entitled to ignore material of which he has actual or constructive knowledge and which may have a direct bearing on the justice of  the case  and to proceed instead on the basis of material that may be incomplete inaccurate or misleadingIt was further submitted that an interpretation of s 3031f which allows for the Tribunal to consider information up until the time of its decision is also consistent with the objects and purpose of the scheme for registration of migration agents The Ministers Second Reading Speech described the scheme as a registration scheme for migration agents designed to improve standards of professional conduct and quality of service reflecting    the Governments concern over the level and nature of complaints made against incompetent or unscrupulous agents complaints which would be familiar to many members of this chamber It also recognises the fact that many of those who are likely to seek the assistance of agents are among the most vulnerable in our society sometimes having a poor grasp of English fear of authority or meagre financial resources G Hand Second Reading Migration Amendment Bill No 3 1992 House of Representatives Hansard 27 May 1992 p 2937The object of the disciplinary provisions in Part 3  it was submitted is to protect the public and to maintain proper standards in the migration profession rather than to take action by way of punishment It would be inimical to this if the Tribunal was prevented from considering relevant information going to the issue of fitness to practice because the information had arisen after the decision under review There was nothing the respondent submitted to suggest that the scheme would be promoted by restricting the Tribunals consideration of an agents integrity and fitness to practise to the earlier date of the decision under review and to ignore the agents current integrity and fitness to practiseIn summary the Authority submitted by way of reply that   1 Applying the principles stated in Freeman  the review of a decision to cancel a migration agents registration on a particular date involves a determination of whether that decision was the correct or preferable decision at that date  2 Where a decision is made to cancel say because an agent does

each The fact that it did not do this proves the Authoritys case rather than the reverseNoting the respondents submission that the Authority was seeking something in the nature of merits review in its second ground the Authority submitted that this was not the case because here the facts have been fully found See Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond 1990 HCA 33  1990 170 CLR 321 at 355 356 per Mason CJ Hope v Bathurst City Council 1980 HCA 16  1980 144 CLR 1 at 7 8 per Mason JThe Authoritys case was that it was not open on the facts found by the Tribunal see the Authoritys principal submissions at 53 supra to conclude otherwise than that the respondent was not a fit and proper personAnother way of identifying the same error was said to be highlighted by the respondents submissions The respondent was made subject to a supervisory obligation during the stay orders This required him not to do protection visa work and to be supervised by another migration agent This order is appropriate in circumstances where the Authority considered that the person is not fit and should be cancelled or suspended but a stay is put in place while the correctness of that decision is being reviewed If however the Authoritys decision to cancel or suspend was not correct this must be because the person was fit and proper On this conclusion it was argued no further supervision or restrictions would be appropriateThe Authority submitted that the very fact that the Tribunal considered that the public interest required the respondent to be supervised and to have his areas of work limited reveals that the Tribunal did not yet think he was fit and proper to be a migration agent That is how the Court can readily conclude that the Tribunal has erred in its application of the law to the facts in this caseThe Authority then turned to address the respondents submission that the Act and the Code envisage that an agent who is not competent in certain areas of practice as a migration agent can nevertheless be fit to be an agent Support for that proposition was said to be found in cl 41 and 42 of the CodeThe Authority submitted that neither of those aspects of the Code accept a lack of competence It envisages that agents may choose not regularly to practice in certain areas which may lead an agent to be unsure of what is appropriate Rather than spend time and money looking this up an agent can refer the matter to another who does work regularly in the field This does not warrant the notion that migration agents can be fit and proper if they cannot be trusted or are otherwise unable to work in certain areas of practice

extrinsic materials it may be answered by noting that the Authoritys construction is also consistent with that object  11 Contrary to the respondents submission it would not be inimical to the achievement of the objects of the provisions if the Tribunal could not have regard to adverse developments that happened after the making of the decision under review The Authority would be having regard to such conduct and is ideally placed to take appropriate action even if a review is pending in relation to an earlier decision indeed this happened in this very case when the respondents registration was suspended while the cancellation review was pending  12 It would however be inimical to the achievement of the objects if agents who have been cancelled for failing to comply with the Code of Conduct or failing to maintain necessary knowledge can avoid that legislated consequence by relying upon subsequent improved conduct and subsequent compliance A system of this kind is less likely to be effective in ensuring that agents comply at all times if there is a perception that the consequences of breaches can be avoided  13 The respondents submissions at 34 supra misconceive Davies Js reasons in Freeman  They did not turn upon the fact that the Tribunal had affirmed the cancellation decision but upon the nature of the decision under review The respondents argument is some kind of bootstraps argument The Tribunals decision is being challenged because it failed to appreciate the nature of its task That task does not have a different nature according to the conclusion it reaches at the end of the task  14 The respondent submitted that all the evidence relied upon by the Tribunal in addressing the question it answered as at September 2005 would have been available if it had asked itself the correct question as at July 2003 This is said to support a futility argument This Court should not accept the proposition that the Tribunals error it is implicitly admitted by the respondent that it did answer the question as at September 2005 and on the Authoritys submissions as to law this would be an error of law could not have made a difference  15 First some of the evidence was not relevant to 14 July 2003    a Is this form of file note taking  does this represent approximately what your current practice would be with taking files notes Yes   AB 550 b Is that representative of your current practice in relation to client agreements AB 551 c Mr Shi do you now keep copies or is it your practice to keep copies of letters on file to your clients Yes yes AB 5553  d The evidence of his success rate from the beginning of 2003 until August 2004 presented in a form that did not disclose that rate as at July 2003 AB 566 567 575 576 803 775 776    16 In any event even if the evidence were all relevant it may have been weighted differently if the correct question were asked The Court should remit the matter to the Tribunal if it finds that the Tribunal misunderstood its task  17 As the Tribunal dealt with all four review decisions together the Court cannot be sure that the Tribunal did not have regard to the later evidence only in relation to the decisions of later dates The point is however that the Tribunal dealt with them all together when it needed to separate the decision according to their nature and the evidence that was relevant to each The fact that it did not do this proves the Authoritys case rather than the reverse

06_1236.xml,c9,related,Shi v The Migration Institute of Australia Ltd [2003] FCA 1304 ; (2003) 134 FCR 326,The Tribunal granted stays in respect of each of the Authoritys decisions the subject of challenge although the first refusal decision was only stayed by consent after the matter had been remitted from this Court to the Tribunal in Shi v The Migration Institute of Australia Ltd 2003 FCA 1304  2003 134 FCR 326 and the cancellation decision was stayed subject to conditions that the respondent be supervised by another migration agent and that he undertake not to engage in any business relating to protection visasThe Tribunal split its decisionmaking process first by making findings of fact on the respondents alleged breaches of the Code of Conduct prescribed by s 314 of the Act finding 51 such breaches of which 47 related to protection visa cases the 6 April 2005 findings and then after receiving submissions on those findings publishing its decision and reasons for decision on 2 September 2005 making findings on whether the respondent was not a person of integrity or was otherwise not a fit and proper person to give immigration assistance pursuant to s 3031f of the Act the 2 September 2005 reasonsThe Tribunal made the following findings of fact in the 6 April 2005 findings   1 The Tribunal found that the respondent did not encourage in the sense of incite any visa applicant to lodge a protection visa application It was therefore unnecessary to decide whether the applications made were grossly unfounded so as to breach cl 217 of the Code as it stood prior to 1 July 1999 at 46 However it found that the respondents handling of these applications was relevant to other alleged breaches of the Code and to a determination pursuant to s 3031f  2 The respondent was unaware of the requirement in cl 217 of the Code introduced in 1999 that he obtain written acknowledgement of advice from his client where his advice had been that the visa application was grossly unfounded but the client nevertheless wished to lodge the application at 67 The Tribunal characterised this as a very serious breach of cl 23 of the Code concerning a sound working knowledge of the Act and Regulations and a consequential breach of cl 21 of the Code concerning a requirement to act in accordance with the law and competently and diligently at 68 3 The respondent did not have a sound working knowledge of the Act and Regulations and was not diligent if he was unaware of provisions of the Code so long after they came into force until they were brought to his attention in the course of investigations as to whether his registration should be cancelled in 2002 at 69 4 The respondent conceded that a number of the applications he had lodged had no hope of success at 66 84 and 106 The Tribunal found that he had made one application that was grossly unfounded at 107 5 The Tribunal found that the respondent had on many occasions breached cl 61 of the Code which requires file notes to be taken of all substantive and material communications between client and agent at 75 79 80 92 99 108 113 116 119 and 215 The Tribunal considered the massive failure in this regard to be serious at 130 The respondent ultimately conceded that he had a systemic problem with keeping adequate file notes and that he had undoubtedly breached cl 61 at 162 6 The Tribunal noted instances where the respondent altered his evidence as he became aware of material which contradicted what he had previously said at 77 87 129 and 146 7 The Tribunal also criticised aspects of the respondents evidence as being speculative and unconvincing explanations proffered when he simply did not know what had occurred in relation to particular clients at 81 82 89 108 109 and 141 It also found many instances where the respondents evidence was designed to excuse his poor handling of an application or filekeeping at 85 88 173 and 222 These and other defects led to aspects of his evidence not being accepted by the Tribunal on the basis of his credit at 90 93 97 103 120 and 167 8 Ultimately the Tribunal did not find Mr Shi a reliable witness His evidence changed on numerous occasions so as to reduce his responsibility for various breaches of the Code or other failures within his practice at 232 9 The Tribunal found that the respondent had failed to sufficiently address matters required by visa applications which constituted a breach of cl 21 and 219 at 78 87 96 and 113 The Tribunal also noted that the respondents applications under s 417 were defective in that they did not address the relevant criteria which the Tribunal found as relevant to his fitness to be a migration agent at 110 10 The Tribunal was critical of the respondents approach that it was his job to state the facts and for the Department to link the facts to the law It considered that it was part of his job to know the relevant criteria at 88 11 The Tribunal found that the respondent had repeatedly breached cl 28 of the Code by failing to keep his clients informed of the progress of their matters and outcomes in writing at 89 92 101 137 and 215 12 The Tribunal found that the respondent had systemically failed to comply with Part 7 of the Code which required documentation of amounts of money paid at 111 and 168 Moreover it found that he had chosen not to comply with trust arrangements to save his own compliance costs at 179 13 The Tribunal set out evidence about the respondents inadequate supervision of his staff in relation to protection visa applications He allowed cutting and pasting of personal claims at 115 118 140 142 and 193 This constituted breaches of cl 81 and 82 of the Code at 194 14 The respondent conceded and the Tribunal found that the respondent had repeatedly breached cl 52 of the Code which required agents to obtain written acceptance of the terms of service as soon as possible after receiving instructions at 159 The Tribunal further found that his failure to comply with this requirement reinforceed its view that he had paid scant attention to the Code at all He ran his business in his own way If a practice satisfied the Code that was coincidental rather than intentional at 160 15 The respondent conceded that his lodging review applications for three clients in the Tribunal which had no jurisdiction in relation to the relevant decision constituted breaches of cl 21b 23 25aiii and cl 41 of the Code at 197 16 The Tribunal noted an instance where the respondent did not appreciate the appropriate procedure What he had done was inappropriate He had no idea what needed to be done at 229 Because what the respondent had done did not amount to the making of an application it did not breach the Code but it was still relevant to his fitness The Tribunal found that this case revealed that the respondent did not possess a sound knowledge of the Act and Regulations as they related to the circumstances of his client at 230In the 2 September 2005 reasons the Tribunal concluded that it was not satisfied that the respondent was not a person of integrity or was not otherwise a fit and proper person to give immigration assistance at 24 The Tribunal made orders setting aside the four decisions under review at 28 31 The cancellation decision was substituted with a decision that the respondent be issued with a caution pursuant to s 3031c  to be lifted after three years provided that the respondent be supervised and not provide immigration assistance with respect to protection visas see s 304A The first refusal decision was substituted with a decision that the respondents repeat registration be approved The suspension decision was substituted with a decision that the respondents registration not be suspended The second refusal decision was substituted with a decision to renew the respondents repeat registrationThe Tribunals reasons for these decisions may be summarised as follows   1 The Tribunal noted the extent and nature of the respondents breaches of the Code at 10 in particular    i that 51 of the alleged 98 breaches had been upheld by the Tribunal and ii that 47 of the 51 sustained breaches related to protection visa cases during the period from September 1998 to October 2001 and the other four related to subclass 457 visa applications filed between October 1997 and January 2000    2 The Tribunal accepted the respondents argument that there was no proven disadvantage to any of the respondents clients because of his conduct at 11 3 The breaches found by the Tribunal considered as a whole indicate that the respondent did not appreciate his obligation to know what the Code required and to comply with its terms as they existed from time to time at 12 and that if his practice satisfied the requirements of the Code that was coincidental rather than intentional at 13 4 The Tribunal noted the respondents contention that 94 per cent of the breaches found related to protection visas an area in which he had ceased to practise and occurred over four years ago at 14 5 The Tribunal noted the respondents argument that his current practice was most relevant when considering issues of public protection and maintenance of proper standards The Tribunal characterised this factor as a relevant consideration at 15 16 6 The respondent also sought to rely upon his current success rate a factor which the Tribunal accepted to be relevant at 17 7 The Tribunal found that in relation to his making s 417 and review applications in the Tribunal the respondents actions reflected a lack of understanding of the relevant law and more importantly a lack of judgment on his part He seemed to just keep doing something to seek review of a decision whether or not there was any real chance of success at 19 8 The Tribunal gave some weight to its adverse findings on the respondents credit at 20 9 As mentioned above having considered all the evidence the Tribunal was not satisfied that the respondent was not a person of integrity or otherwise not a fit and proper person to give immigration assistance within the meaning of s 3031f at 24 10 The Tribunal took into account that the respondent had had a supervising migration agent for over two years who was a knowledgeable and experienced migration agent and who held the respondent in high regard It also gave weight to the fact that there had been no breaches since the cancellation decision was made and the respondents rate of success had been very high in recent years at 24 11 The Tribunal concluded that cancellation was not appropriate in relation to the respondents breaches of the Code s 3031h It considered that the appropriate decision was to issue a caution subject to conditions at 25 26

06_1243.xml,c3,applied,"Northern Territory of Australia v Alyawarr, Kaytetye, Warumungu, Wakaya Native Title Claim Group [2005] FCAFC 135",It is convenient to note and adopt some observations about s 223 1 made in the final submissions by counsel for the applicants   In the joint judgment in Yorta Yorta  Mabo  is cited as providing an explanation of the consequences of sovereignty upon existing indigenous rights and interests in land The fundamental premise from which the decision in Mabo  proceeded is that the laws and customs of the indigenous peoples of the country constituted bodies of normative rules which could give rise to and had in fact given rise to rights and interests in relation to land or waters The fundamental premise from which the Act proceeds is that the rights and interests with which it deals can be possessed under traditional laws and customs   As the definition in s2231 refers to traditional laws acknowledged and as opposed to or  traditional customs observed there is no need to distinguish between what is a matter of traditional law and what is a matter of traditional custom  The Full Court in Alyawarr has stated  that this does not require fine distinctions to be drawn between legal rules and moral obligations Nevertheless there must be some kind of rules having a normative content and those rules must derive from a body of norms or normative system that existed before sovereignty   In Yorta Yorta  the High Court noted that the reference to a normative system of traditional laws and customs may be distracting if undue attention is given to the word system  particularly if it were to be understood as confined in its application to systems of law that have all the characteristics of a developed European body of written laws Similarly the rights and interests possessed under traditional laws and customs often will not correspond to common law or European concepts The application of common law or Eurocentric concepts of property or of normative systems is likely to mislead    The rights and interests under traditional laws and customs will often reflect a different conception of property or belonging But none of those considerations denies the normative quality of the laws and customs of the indigenous societies It is only if the rich complexity of indigenous societies is denied that reference to traditional laws and customs as a normative system jars the ear of the listener  Footnotes omitted Original emphasis The concluding quotation comes from the judgment in Yorta Yorta of Gleeson CJ Gummow and Hayne JJ at 40 The full reference to Alyawarr is Northern Territory of Australia v Alyawarr Kaytetye Warumungu Wakaya Native Title Claim Group 2005 FCAFC 135  145 FCR 442All of the present claims are communal or group claims as distinct from individual claims The concepts of communal and group rights and interests are not defined or explained by the Act However it is legitimate to draw on what Brennan J said about such interests in Mabo  see Alyawarr at 69 His Honour said at 62   A communal native title enures for the benefit of the community as a whole and for the subgroups and individuals within it who have particular rights and interests in the communitys lands   The recognition of the rights and interests of a subgroup or individual dependent on a communal native title is not precluded by an absence of a communal law to determine a point in contest between rival claimants By custom such a point may have to be settled by community consensus or in some other manner prescribed by customAs might be expected having regard to these statements of principle there are cases in which communal native title has been recognised over the whole of an area of land notwithstanding that estate groups were found to have particular rights to parts of that land see Western Australia v Ward 2000 FCA 191  2000 99 FCR 316  Ward FC1  first Full Court decision at 203  204 Neowarra v Western Australia 2003 FCA 1402  Neowarra  at 393 and Alyawarr at 69 71 In Alyawarr  the Full Court drew attention to the form of the declaration made in Mabo  Notwithstanding evidence that groups and individuals had particular rights and interests in relation to parts of the Murray Islands the High Court declared that the Meriam people are entitled as against the whole world to possession occupation use and enjoyment of the lands of the Murray IslandsIn relation to the last matter counsel noted something said by Brennan J in Mabo  at 61   Of course in time the laws and customs of any people will change and the rights and interests of the members of the people among themselves will change too But so long as the people remain as an identifiable community the members of whom are identified by one another as members of that community living under its laws and customs the communal native title survives to be enjoyed by the members according to the rights and interests to which they are respectively entitled under the traditionallybased laws and customs as currently acknowledged and observedCounsel cited from Sundberg J in Neowarra at 310 Mansfield J in Alyawarr at first instance 2004 FCA 472 at 156  and Merkel J in Rubibi Community v State of Western Australia No 6 2006 FCA 82 at 115  Rubibi This submission may be accepted However its limitations should be noted In any communal native title case it is necessary for the Court to determine whether the claimed native title extends to the whole or any part of the claimed area However it is not necessary and it would be inappropriate for the Court to become involved in issues as to the intracommunal distribution of special rights over portions of the total area in relation to which native title has been established The Court leaves it to the community to determine those issues Alyawarr illustrates the point see 81 110112 and paras 2 and 6 of the formal determination which is set out at 504505 See also Ward FC1 at 202 Of course if the applicants have no communal native title rights or interests over any identifiable part of the claimed area but only if the position is that other people have rights over parts of it the claim will failWAFIC supported the position of the State and the Commonwealth Mr McKenna said   It is entirely clear that a central aspect of the claim for native title is identification of a normative system of traditional laws and customs under which the native title rights and interests are derived and in respect of which those rights and interests are held by a community group or individual It is suggested that the rights that may arise from the different connections in this case give rise to different rights in different areas being held by different people That is not necessarily a bar to all or some of those people holding all or some of the rights claimed but it does require a more specific approach than the Applicants advocateAt a later point in his submissions while discussing a supposed distinction between proprietary and usufructuary rights counsel said   It is not to the point that the native title rights and interests are characterised as proprietary or usufructory sic The key issue from WAFICs perspective is the traditional law under which those rights whether proprietary or usufructory sic or both arise and     a the group of persons who have those rights under traditional law and custom and   b the area over with sic the traditional laws and customs mandate the existence of such rights and interestsMr Wittkuhn expressed the issue in similar termsI accept the submission of the State which is supported by other respondents that the Applicants must establish a connection with the area that is the subject of the separate question that is the land and waters included in Part A as delineated on the map attached to the order of 21 December 2005 and the appended map 2 the Perth Metropolitan Area However I do not accept the submission expressly or implicitly made by the State and other respondents that the Applicants must demonstrate this connection in a manner that is specific to the Perth Metropolitan Area and divorced from their asserted connection to the whole claim area The Perth Metropolitan Area is part of the claim area If the Applicants succeed in demonstrating the necessary s 2231 connection between themselves and the whole claim area or an identified part of it that includes the Perth Metropolitan Area they demonstrate the required connection to the Perth Metropolitan Area The whole includes its partsIn their written closing submissions counsel for the Applicants sought to justify a broadlyworded determination about occupation use and enjoyment in this way   The rights and interests which the Noongar people currently possess under their traditional laws and customs are the same as the rights and interests which existed at sovereignty notwithstanding adaptations and changes to the relevant laws and customs The Noongar people still assert and exercise those rights and interests to the extent to which they are able to do so Within the Metropolitan Claim area they still hunt for kangaroo in the Perth hills and for turtles in the local swamps They continue to protect and to pass on knowledge about their sacred sites and about the Wagyl  They still speak for that country principally these days through their involvement in site surveys and by registering and otherwise acting to protect their sacred sites The Noongar people have a history well before the commencement of the Act of taking strong protest action to prevent development within Perth which might harm sites associated with the Wagyl   The obvious practical difficulties which stand in the way of the Noongar people exercising a right of exclusive possession occupation use and enjoyment in an urban and semiurban environment does not preclude the Court from recognising the existence of that right  the definition of native title and of native title rights and interests in s2231 is directed to the possession of the rights or interests not their exercise  The following passage from the judgment of Merkel J in Rubibi at 117 is on point     I have some concern as to how a right of exclusive possession and occupation can operate in any practical way in urban and other areas in common use by the general community However as was explained in Neowarra the difficulty in practical enforcement of a native title right is not a proper ground for denying its existence Further as usage is closely linked with the issue of extinguishment I have concluded that the existence and extent of the right is to be considered in that context rather than in the context of practicality     In this proceeding the Court is determining the existence and the content of native title as a separate question without regard to the issue of extinguishment Citations omittedCounsel referred to a comment of Sundberg J in Neowarra at 364   Because the rights and interests of Aboriginal peoples must be possessed under their traditional laws and customs they must be looked at from the perspective of the claimants as the anthropologists put it from an emic as opposed to an etic perspective Section 2231c would seem to confirm that the rights and interests in par a are to be viewed emically and then must pass the test posed by par c namely that the Aboriginallyviewed rights or interests are recognised by the common law Counsel went on   The Aboriginal witnesses gave evidence using various terms and concepts to describe their rights and interests as derived from their laws and customs While the witnesses did not use the common law expression  possess occupy use and enjoy the land to the exclusion of all others  that is what the rights and entitlements of which they gave evidence amounts toCounsel cited Ward HC  where Gleeson CJ Gaudron Gummow and Hayne JJ said at 8889   It may be accepted that  a core concept of traditional law and custom is the right to be asked permission and to speak for country It is the rights under traditional law and custom to be asked permission and to speak for country that are expressed in common law terms as a right to possess occupy use and enjoy land to the exclusion of all others The expression of these rights and interests in these terms reflects not only the content of a right to be asked permission about how and by whom country may be used but also the common laws concern to identify property relationships between people and places or things as rights of control over access to and exploitation of the place or thing   The expression possession occupation use and enjoyment  to the exclusion of all others is a composite expression directed to describing a particular measure of control over access to land To break the expression into its constituent elements is apt to mislead In particular to speak of possession of the land as distinct from possession to the exclusion of all others invites attention to the common law content of the concept of possession and whatever notions of control over access might be thought to be attached to it rather than to the relevant task which is to identify how rights and interests possessed under traditional law and custom can properly find expression in common law termsParagraph e asserts a right to control access and use of the lands and waters by all Aboriginal people not only Noongars However the evidence justifies only recognition of a right concerning Aboriginal people who seek access to or use of the claim area in accordance with traditional law and custom Upon that basis the criterion is acknowledgement of the binding force of traditional law and custom Such a criterion avoids the reproach levied in Alyawarr at 151 of being based merely upon Aboriginality I think para e should be includedParagraphs f and g are uncontroversial and amply supported by the evidence They should be included in any determination However the wording needs to be tightened in such a manner as to relate these rights directly to land and watersThe concluding part of Schedule E asserts a claim of exclusive possession occupation use and enjoyment of the following six listed types of area    a any areas where there has been no previous extinguishment of native title  b any area of natural water resources that is found not to be tidal  c any areas affected by category C and D past and intermediate period acts  d s47 Pastoral leases held by native title claimants  e s47A

opposition was raised to the filing of the amended notice of appeal nor to the presentation by the appellants of the case articulated by their counsel in belated written submissions nor to the joinder of the Refugee Review Tribunal as an additional respondent That joinder occurred consistently with the view of the High Court expressed in SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs 2005 HCA 24  2005 215 ALR 162 to the effect that the Tribunal is an officer of the Commonwealth for the purpose of s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 Cth Before proceeding further it is appropriate that I outline the reasons of the Federal Magistrate upon his review of the Tribunal decision below that is of course the second or later Tribunal decision of 16 December 2005Nicholls FM summarised the appellants complaints as outlined to the Federal Magistrates Court by way of the amended application for review by way of appeal filed on 24 November 2004 as follows i denial of procedural fairness and natural justice by reason of the Tribunals bias or by reason that there was an apprehension of bias    ii withholding by the Tribunal from the appellants of independent country information about Bangladesh and of the opportunity to comment thereon and    iii failure by the Tribunal to take a fresh look into the appellants protection visa claim and a totally ignoring by the Tribunal of that claim which was asserted on behalf of the appellants to be 100 true and as involving what was alleged by the appellants to be a political crisis within the BNP and an absence of protection available to the appellants by what was described as the adult male appellants own partyIn the result his Honour found no substance or viability in relation to those complaints However as will be seen from my ongoing summary of the reasons for decision of the Federal Magistrates Court below it is necessary for me to set out in more detail his Honours reasoned findings given the width of scope of the issues addressed by his HonourNicholls FM ultimately addressed what became the critical discretionary issue as to delay by the appellants in their pursuit of their second Tribunal application before proceeding to address the three issues broadly formulated as above by his Honour and which I have outlined in the preceding paragraph That issue of delay became ultimately the basis for dismissal of the appeal which occurred at the culmination of his Honours consideration of the various other issues raised in the Federal Magistrates Court below The issue of delay was described by his Honour as unexplained and inconsistent with the action of someone who claims to fear persecution and who claims to be aggrieved by a Tribunal decision which did not recognise these claims  His Honour referred to authority involving recognition of the element of discretion attending the exercise of the grant or refusal of prerogative relief in a migration law context in particular in circumstances of unwarrantable delay An exemplification of High Court authority on the subject of circumstances of unwarrantable delay identified by his Honour was Re Refugee Review Tribunal Ex parte Aala 2000 HCA 57  2000 204 CLR 82 at 53 and 82 Gaudron and Gummow JJ Reference was also made to what was observed subsequently by McHugh J in SAAP at 80 on the matter of delayReturning therefore to the operation of s 424A and related matters arising Nicholls FM found in summary as follows   the context of any SAAPAl Shamry issue the country information referred to by the Tribunal the judiciary and politics and in the statutory context clearly fell within the exemption provided in s 424A3a from the obligation contained in s 424A1 The Tribunals finding on relocation was consistent with the relevant test and open to it on the material before it  The reference above to Al Shamry was to the Full Federal Court decision in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Al Shamry 2001 FCA 919  2001 110 FCR 27 I have already of course made brief reference to SAAPNicholls FM next addressed another issue which has arisen with more attention on this appeal which may be described as whether even if the Tribunal had not fulfilled the requirements of s 424A of the Migration Act in relation to any ground or set of reasons upon or by reference to which the decision of the Tribunal was made there existed at least more unimpeachable grounds or sets of reasons on which the decision had been rightly based The Tribunal was said by his Honour to have clearly differentiated between at least the three sets of reasons that it gave for affirming the decision under review Those three grounds or sets of reasons of the Tribunal being the subject of subpars c d and e of par 1 of the amended notice of appeal extracted in 3 above and described by the Tribunal as three good sets of reasons for concluding that the applicants have no real chance of persecution for a Convention reason if returned to Bangladesh  are appropriate to reproduce in sequence and to the extent of virtually their entire text below   because the claims made by the applicant on key issues have changed from time to time in significant ways To prove this point it is enough to see the differences in the claims about the applicants employment place of residence when he reported the claimed 19 March 1997 attack and whether there were arrest warrants issued for him In addition whichever version of his place of residence one believes it is remarkable that in both versions he claims to have been at the one address for significant periods either side of the June 1996 election and thus was at that address at a time when he claims that he was attacked several times by the Awami League it is not credible that a person who is supposedly under serious sustained attack from his enemies would continue to reside at his longterm address which is no doubt why he modified the claim about residence when he initiated his second case The differences mentioned and this point about the address lead me to conclude that the applicant has exaggerated or fabricated his political activism and the situation he faced and faces in Bangladesh I attach no significance to the documents he provided because he undercut the credibility of some of them himself and the country information on page 13 and my own experience of dozens of Bangladeshi cases alert me to the notorious unreliability of such documents   because the applicants behaviour before and after his various lodgements of claims relating to the 1997 case and the 2001 case has not been consistent with that of a person with a genuine fear of persecution for a Convention reason The only places which he mentioned in relation to his political activity and the threats to him are in Dhaka district and there is no reason to suppose that he was known or threatened outside Dhaka yet he apparently made no effort to relocate within Bangladesh to one of the 63 districts outside Dhaka He did not leave Bangladesh until over two months after he obtained his Australian visa  When he left Bangladesh he left legally and by using a passport in his own name  His first application for a protection visa was made in July 1997 four weeks after he arrived in June  He did not supply a set of Conventionrelated claims until 22 months later in May 1999 His oral evidence at the RRT hearing in May 1999 was unconvincing see decision N9718939 He did not bother to be represented at the Federal Court hearing of his appeal in September 1999 He allowed a gap of 18 months between the final end of his first case in January 2000 and the initiation of his second case July 2001 His statutory declaration received by DIMIA in July 2001 was simply a copy of his one submitted 26 months before He did not respond to the July 2001 letter from DIMIA  He has never provided the material which he promised in his September 2001 RRT application  He did not bother to attend the 28 April 2003 RRT hearing he had promised to attend  This catalogue of repeated tardiness and failure to cooperate leads me to conclude that the applicant was in no hurry to go anywhere or to do anything because there was no reason for him to be in a hurry because he had and has no fear of persecution   because even if his claims about what happened to him in 1997 and before were true they have been overtaken by events He has been out of Bangladesh for six years and I see no reason to suppose that any political enemies he had then would continue to be interested in him The party which he claims to support is now in government and the country information on pages 10 to 12 leads me to conclude that that confers advantages on its supporters in terms of benevolent treatment from the organs of the state In terms of any legal action the applicant faces I note that he has not been convicted of a crime or any offence  For reasons given elsewhere in this decision I do not believe that his claim that he faces any cases false or otherwise is credible but if he does face a case or cases then I conclude from the country information on the judiciary that he would eventually secure justice Moreover any cases resulting from the politicallymotivated animus of his supposed opponents during the previous Awami League administration would clearly be seen for what they are and be treated accordingly   are 64 districts in Bangladesh  The only district he has mentioned is Dhaka district The fact that he kept living there for so long despite the supposed threat to him leads me to conclude that he did not fear persecution there because he has exaggerated or fabricated that threat    for any reason the applicant does not wish to live in Dhaka district the country information leads me to conclude that there are many other parts of the country in which it would be reasonable to expect him to be able to relocate He has managed to support himself and his family in an unfamiliar country Australia for almost six years so I have no doubt of his ability to support himself and them in the country in which he was born was educated spent most of his life and still has family   the applicant wishes to pursue politics in Bangladesh in a manner which does not involve thuggery and criminality of the sort which characterises much of Bangladeshi politics the material leads me to conclude that he would be able to do so and have little to fear from rival political groups especially if he pursued such activities outside of Dhaka districtIt was in any event in the context of the appellants case for contravention of s 424A that the appellants drew attention to SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs 2006 FCAFC 2  2006 150 FCR 214 at 230  234 Allsop J where in the light of what was said in Aala and SAAP  his Honour observed as follows as to consequences flowing generally from a beach by the Minister of s 424A   Section 424A not having been complied with the appellant is entitled to statutory writs under s 39B1 of the Judiciary Act 1903 unless a legitimate reason to withhold such relief can be identified    subject to what follows if s 424A is not complied with the Court does not engage in an enquiry as to whether the breach was so trivial as not to warrant relief The failure to comply with the statutorily mandated provisions leads to the conclusion that there was a lack of statutory authority to make the decision In the operation of s 424A and the principles of procedural fairness adherence to mandated process and procedure is vital as a matter of discretion relief will be withheld for reasons going to the conduct of the applicant as discussed in Aala and SAAP  No such considerations apply here if it can be shown that there is a basis otherwise unimpeached upon which the decision was reached unaffected by the failure to accord procedural fairness or to comply with the required statutory procedure relief can be withheld      What the majority in SAAP stated was that one did not engage in an evaluative analysis of the triviality or seriousness of the failure to observe the statutory requirements The same was said by Gaudron and Gummow JJ in Aala However Aala and SAAP leave open the basis to refuse relief if it can be shown that grant of relief would lack utility The examples given in Aala  were     a where the decisionmaker was bound by the governing statute   b where the submissions could only have been answered as a matter of law against the person denied the opportunity of making them and   c if the decision under review has no legal effect   If it can be shown that there was a basis for the Tribunals decision which can be seen to be entirely independent of the failure to follow s 424A in my view that is sufficiently analogous to the first of the alternatives referred to inAala to warrant withholding of relief     The federal magistrate concluded that the Tribunal found that even if the claims made by the applicant were true he was not a refugee Unlike the federal magistrate I am unable to discern such a clear basis upon which the failure to follow s 424A had no possible effect The influence of credit appears to me to pervade the whole of the reasons of the Tribunal The failure to comply with s 424A has not been shown to be entirely separate from an unimpeached basis for the decision The further issues remain therefore first as to whether in all the circumstances the Tribunal did contravene s 424A in the light of what was held at 233 of SZEEU above as to a basis for the Tribunals decision which is entirely independent of the failure to follow s 424A and in any event whether any discretionary factor being delay in particular should so operate as to deny relief to the appellants As to the existence of any contravention of s 424A there remains of course the issue of an absence or otherwise of operation of subsection 1 thereof in any of the circumstances excepted by the terms of subsection 3 thereof relating to  information not about the applicant and just about a class of persons of which the applicant is a member  or information that the applicant gave for the purpose of the application
06_1244.xml,c1,cited,Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex parte Aala [2000] HCA 57 ; (2000) 204 CLR 82,Nicholls FM ultimately addressed what became the critical discretionary issue as to delay by the appellants in their pursuit of their second Tribunal application before proceeding to address the three issues broadly formulated as above by his Honour and which I have outlined in the preceding paragraph That issue of delay became ultimately the basis for dismissal of the appeal which occurred at the culmination of his Honours consideration of the various other issues raised in the Federal Magistrates Court below The issue of delay was described by his Honour as unexplained and inconsistent with the action of someone who claims to fear persecution and who claims to be aggrieved by a Tribunal decision which did not recognise these claims  His Honour referred to authority involving recognition of the element of discretion attending the exercise of the grant or refusal of prerogative relief in a migration law context in particular in circumstances of unwarrantable delay An exemplification of High Court authority on the subject of circumstances of unwarrantable delay identified by his Honour was Re Refugee Review Tribunal Ex parte Aala 2000 HCA 57  2000 204 CLR 82 at 53 and 82 Gaudron and Gummow JJ Reference was also made to what was observed subsequently by

primarily required to consider was whether the circumstances of the case made the withholding of relief the proper course given that the writ issues as of right unless it is unjust to withhold it the appellants citing in that regard R v Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration Ex parte Ozone Theatres Aust Ltd 1949 HCA 33  1949 78 CLR 389 at 400 and Aala at 5152 and 56 per Gaudron and

of ensuring the legality of government action against the secondary consideration of the finality of litigation the appellants further citing respectively Aala at 55 Gaudron and Gummow JJ That scope of finding by Nicholls J referrable to delay was however in my opinion clearly open to his Honour to find at least in the circumstances to which his Honour referred I am unable to accept that his

06_1244.xml,c10,referred_to,"Randhawa v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (1994) 52 FCR 437",Further findings of the Tribunal recorded and relied upon by Nicholls FM below included the following to which I have already made partial reference but repeat for completeness  the appellants could safely and reasonably relocate out of their home district the Dhaka district in Bangladesh to one of the other 63 districts in Bangladesh   the Tribunal was clearly conscious of the relevant test to be applied in considering the issue of relocation namely that the Tribunal should not merely address whether an applicant could relocate to another area but whether the applicants could reasonably be expected to do so  Randhawa v Minister for Immigration Local Government and Ethnic Affairs 1994 52 FCR 437 at 442 per Black CJ  the Tribunal did look specifically at the relevant country information about population size and dispersal in Bangladesh the dispersal and spread of relevant political parties issues relating to politics and violence in Bangladesh and the judiciary and police and the role they played in Bangladeshi affairs and also the appellant husband fathers ability to support himself and his family in an unfamiliar country Australia for almost six years and found that it had no doubt that the appellant husband had the ability to support himself and his family in the country in which he was born and educated spent most of his life and still had familyUpon the footing of each of those three good sets of reasons socalled by the Tribunal the Tribunal made supplementary observations to be read in conjunction therewith including reference to Randhawa v Minister for Immigration Local Government and Ethnic Affairs 1994 52 FCR 437 at 440443 for the proposition which I have already foreshadowed that protection is not available in the case of a wellfounded fear in an applicants home region where that applicant can nevertheless avail himself or herself of the real protection of his or her country of nationality elsewhere within that country  The Court added the qualification that the applicant must also be able to genuinely access domestic protection  and relocation needs to be a reasonable option in the particular circumstances see in that regard Beaumont J at 4501 The Tribunal member concluded his reasons for decision as follows   the above reasons I conclude that the applicant does not face Conventionrelated persecution in Bangladesh because there is nothing credible in his claims to indicate that he has a profile which would lead to him being wanted by the Awami League or the authorities or anyone else outside of Dhaka let alone in Dhaka   inadequacies and inconsistencies of the applicants claims and of his behaviour in pursuit of his claims lead me to conclude that the applicant did not and does not have a genuine fear of persecution The reasons set out above lead me to conclude that he has no wellfounded fear of persecution within the meaning of the Convention Accordingly I am satisfied that he is not a refugeeIt was partly in the context of the formulation of those three sets of reasons of the Tribunal of a fundamentally factual or circumstantial character and of his Honours consideration of the implications thereof that Nicholls FM concluded his reasons for judgment below by reference to what he described as the critical issue arising on the appeal to the Federal Magistrates Court explained as follows   critical issue therefore even if the Tribunal breached the requirements of s 424A as understood in the context of SAAP in relation to one ground sets of reasons upon which the decision was made is whether there is one or more other grounds on which the decision was based which cannot or are not impeached That is was there another separate basis or bases upon which the decisions may be supported The Tribunal itself by the very language that it used clearly differentiated between at least three sets of reasons that it gave for affirming the decision under review Bearing in mind the relevant authorities even if there is some difficulty in the Tribunals first set of stated reasons the first part of the first set the second and third reasons independently and separately from each other and then the Tribunals separate and independent finding in relation to relocation are each not in my view affected by jurisdictional error and can independently support the Tribunals ultimate conclusion that the applicant did not satisfy the relevant criteria for a protection visa Had I not dismissed on the basis of unwarrantable delay I would have dismissed on this basis in any event  I have earlier of course made reference to that delay attributed by the Federal Magistrate to the appellantsIt is of assistance in the context of the complexity and detail of the reasoning and findings of the Tribunal and of Nicholls FM below to read the conclusions of his Honour upon the four principal issues identified by his Honour in association with his summary of the Tribunals findings appearing in 5 of his reasons for judgment below Those issues may be described as has been foreshadowed first as to exaggerations and fabrications of the adult male appellant in respect of his political activism secondly as to behaviour inconsistent with his having any genuine fear of persecution thirdly as to recent independent country information and fourthly as to the implications of the country information concerning safety of relocation in Bangladesh available to the appellants Such four themes are not to be read in any mutually exclusive way as is apparent from the text of the socalled three sets of reasons of the Tribunal  ante The material presented in writing by the appellants at the hearing of the appeal from the decision of the Federal Magistrates Court consisted of an amended notice of appeal and written submissions which were provided by the appellants only several days prior to the hearing of the appeal It is appropriate that I reproduce the text or substance as the case may be of the appellants written submissions and address such oral submissions of additional significance as ultimately pursued by the appellants The issues raised by the appellants in the amended notice of appeal were framed mainly in relation to their contentions as to the operation of s 424A of the Migration Act in circumstances postulated by the respective parties and did not explicitly address the critical issue of unwarrantable delay on the part of the appellants which latter issue was however the subject of oral submissions The Minister submitted that the appeal could be dismissed on the basis that the issue of unwarrantable delay was not touched upon in the notice of appeal or the amended notice of appeal
06_1244.xml,c11,applied,VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 206 ALR 471,Much has been written about the scope and purpose of operation of s 424A  but in my opinion two aspects thereof may be conveniently emphasised each being highlighted in the joint judgment of Finn and Stone JJ in VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs 2004 206 ALR 471 at 23   the Tribunal must possess the information   the Tribunal must consider that that information would be the reason or part of the reason for affirming the decision under reviewMoreover when it becomes necessary or appropriate for the Tribunal to make findings and formulate conclusions cumulatively though in stages and being unavoidable in situations involving some measure of complexity of evidentiary material such as here exemplified in relation to the three socalled sets of reasons of the Tribunal and reproduced already in these reasons at 24 above it is of practical assistance to an implementation of the s 424A1a process to bear in mind the following further observations appearing in the joint reasons for judgment of Finn and Stone JJ in VAF at 33 and 41 respectively   It commonly is the case that the detail and complexity of the case advanced by a visa applicant and the information that is given and garnered for the purposes of considering it results in the Tribunal being confronted with issues that may be of varying importance relevance and centrality both to the decision to be taken and to the reasoning that in the event sustains that decision While the reasoning process may advert to and express views on such issues all will not necessarily constitute part of the reason for the Tribunals decision Tribunals no less than courts engage in their own species of dicta often enough for reasons related to haste and pressure in composition When a Tribunals reasons are to be evaluated for s 424A1 purposes the Court as a matter of judgment is required to isolate what were the integral parts of the reasons for the Tribunals decision That task necessarily is an interpretative one In some instances the differentiation of the integral and the inessential may be by no means easy and made the more so by less than explicit indications in the reasons themselves as to what the tribunal itself considered to be integral   Considered in the context of the Tribunals reasoning process and having regard to the aggregate of findings made that rejected both that the appellant had been persecuted for a Convention reason and that his situation was such as to give rise to a well founded fear of persecution reference to the information as to his behaviour in Australia can only be categorised as being relatively minor and unimportant in the scheme of things It was not so integral to the reasoning process rejecting the appellants claim as to require as a matter of fairness that the appellant be told that information cf s 424A1a and why it was relevant to the review cf s 424A1b It was stated widely by the appellants at the threshold of their written submissions that Nicholls FM found that the socalled first set of reasons appearing in the Tribunals decision was affected by a breach of s 424A of the Migration Act as a consequence of the tribunal using information given by the first appellant husbandfather in his protection visa application as a part of its reasons for affirming the decision of the delegate That first set of reasons addressed the implications of what the Tribunal described as the claims made by the applicant on key issues having changed from time to time in significant ways by reason of the circumstances thereby exemplified  His Honour summarised those circumstances attending the first set of reasons as comprising or involving differences or inconsistencies found between details that the first appellant had put to the delegate and the account given to the Tribunal which led the Tribunal to conclude that the first appellant had exaggerated or fabricated his political activism and the situation of harm that he faced in Bangladesh Nicholls FM observed that the Tribunal relied on the inconsistencies in the appellants claim in its reasons for decision rather than the information contained in the visa application and that in the alternative that even if the first set of reasons of the Tribunals decision did not contain jurisdictional error it did not have necessary consequence in the ultimate decision to affirm the delegates decision because of other independent reasons given for affirming the delegates decision The submissions of the appellants by way of response to the socalled second and third sets of reasons commenced to the effect that in considering whether to grant relief the Federal Magistrate found the other two sets of reasons for affirming the decision were not affected by the breach of s 424A  and were said to have provided an alternative basis upon which the decision could be made The applicants referring thereby apparently to the Tribunals decision that the first appellant could secure justice in circumstances where he faced false charges in Bangladesh and to the Tribunals finding as to the appellants absence of effort to relocate outside the Dhaka district of Bangladesh to elsewhere in one of the 63 districts of that country His Honour summarised the circumstances attending the socalled second set of reasons as being based on the first appellants behaviour both before and after the lodgement of claims in 1997 and 2001 and on the Tribunals finding that his actions were not consistent with a genuine fear of persecution for Convention reasons His Honour observed that the Tribunal characterised these actions on the part of the appellants as a repeated failure to provide documents and claims as promised unconvincing oral evidence and a catalogue of repeated tardiness and failure to cooperate referring thereby to page 15 of the Tribunals reasonsHis Honour summarised those circumstances attending the socalled third set of reasons as being based on the Tribunal finding that even if the first appellants claims about what happened to him in 1997 and previously were true that the events and situations giving rise to those claims have been overtaken by more recent events and that i n particular the Tribunal relied on independent country information which showed that the party which the first appellant claimed to support was at the time of the Tribunals consideration in government and further that the independent information led it to conclude that this conferred an advantage on its supporters in terms of the level of treatment from the organs of the State That summary of his Honour continued further that the Tribunal found that it did not believe the first appellants claim that he faced false cases as being credible but even in the event that he did face some charges then the Tribunal concluded from the country information available to it that he would eventually secure justice referring thereby to pages 15 and 16 of the Tribunals reasonsLastly his Honour summarised the circumstances further attending the Tribunals reasons generally that the Tribunal  also looked at the issue of relocation and whether protection was available in another part of Bangladesh and found that as the first appellant had only referred in his claims to one Dhaka of the 64 districts in Bangladesh and based on independent country information available to it pages 9 and 13 of the Tribunals reasons appearing under the heading Country information the first appellant would be able to safely relocate to another part of Bangladesh and that it would be reasonable to expect him to so relocate pages 16 and 17 of the Tribunals reasons I should interpolate to point out the compelling force of that location observation
06_1244.xml,c12,referred_to,SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 2 ; (2006) 150 FCR 214,It was in any event in the context of the appellants case for contravention of s 424A that the appellants drew attention to SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs 2006 FCAFC 2  2006 150 FCR 214 at 230  234 Allsop J where in the light of what was said in Aala and SAAP  his Honour observed as follows as to consequences flowing generally from a beach by the Minister of s 424A   Section 424A not having been complied with the appellant is entitled to statutory writs under s 39B1 of the Judiciary Act 1903 unless a legitimate reason to withhold such relief can be identified    subject to what follows if s 424A is not complied with the Court does not engage in an enquiry as to whether the breach was so trivial as not to warrant relief The failure to comply with the statutorily mandated provisions leads to the conclusion that there was a lack of statutory authority to make the decision In the operation of s 424A and the principles of procedural fairness adherence to mandated process and procedure is vital as a matter of discretion relief will be withheld for reasons going to the conduct of the applicant as discussed in Aala and SAAP  No such considerations apply here if it can be shown that there is a basis otherwise unimpeached upon which the decision was reached unaffected by the failure to accord procedural fairness or to comply with the required statutory procedure relief can be withheld      What the majority in SAAP stated was that one did not engage in an evaluative analysis of the triviality or seriousness of the failure to observe the statutory requirements The same was said by Gaudron and Gummow JJ in Aala However Aala and SAAP leave open the basis to refuse relief if it can be shown that grant of relief would lack utility The examples given in Aala  were     a where the decisionmaker was bound by the governing statute   b where the submissions could only have been answered as a matter of law against the person denied the opportunity of making them and   c if the decision under review has no legal effect   If it can be shown that there was a basis for the Tribunals decision which can be seen to be entirely independent of the failure to follow s 424A in my view that is sufficiently analogous to the first of the alternatives referred to inAala to warrant withholding of relief     The federal magistrate concluded that the Tribunal found that even if the claims made by the applicant were true he was not a refugee Unlike the federal magistrate I am unable to discern such a clear basis upon which the failure to follow s 424A had no possible effect The influence of credit appears to me to pervade the whole of the reasons of the Tribunal The failure to comply with s 424A has not been shown to be entirely separate from an unimpeached basis for the decision The further issues remain therefore first as to whether in all the circumstances the Tribunal did contravene s 424A in the light of what was held at 233 of SZEEU above as to a basis for the Tribunals decision which is entirely independent of the failure to follow s 424A and in any event whether any discretionary factor being delay in particular should so operate as to deny relief to the appellants As to the existence of any contravention of s 424A there remains of course the issue of an absence or otherwise of operation of subsection 1 thereof in any of the circumstances excepted by the terms of subsection 3 thereof relating to  information not about the applicant and just about a class of persons of which the applicant is a member  or information that the applicant gave for the purpose of the applicationAs to the existence of any such basis for the Tribunals decision which was entirely independent of a failure to follow s 424A1 see again 233 of SZEEU extracted above the Minister referred to a number of Federal Court authorities exemplifying denial of relief in circumstances constituting an independent basis for a decision unaffected by breach of s 424A1 including VEAJ of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs 2003 FCA 678  2003 132 FCR 291 see in particular 5455 per Gray J Upon that footing the Minister pointed out that Nicholls FM had concluded that not only the relocation findings but also the remaining aspects of the Tribunals socalled three good sets of reasons  which I have reproduced earlier at 24 of my reasons were unaffected by any breach of s 424A that existed in relation to the first of those separate and independent basesThe appellants submitted in any event that on the basis of the following principles an examination of the sets of reasons shows that all three sets of reasons forming the parts of the reasons for affirming the decision of the Tribunal are affected by a breach of s 424A the appellants thereby referring to the reasons I have reproduced at length in 24 above It was asserted by the appellants that information given to the Ministers Department and obtained by the Tribunal from the Department and not from the appellants is not subject to s 424A3b and I was referred in that regard to the Full Courts reasons for judgment in Al Shamry at 1718 per Ryan J and myself jointly and at 4041 per Merkel J I reproduce below 17 of the reasons in Al Shamry for ease of reference   Counsel for the Minister accepted that a failure to observe the procedure laid down by s 424A is a reviewable error under s 4761a It was also accepted that where there is information of the kind described in s 424A1a particulars of that information must be given to the applicant for the purpose of obtaining his or her comments However it was said that the information constituted by the airport interview came within the exception created by s 424A3b in respect of information given by the applicant for the purpose of the application Application in that context was said to mean all information given by the applicant to officials in the Department including that provided to the Tribunal for the purpose of determining whether to grant a protection visa to the applicant We disagree In our view applicant wherever appearing in s 424A means applicant for review by the Tribunal of a Ministerial decision and application correspondingly means the proceeding before the Tribunal which is the vehicle for such a claim for reviewIt was then submitted by the appellants that such information that the tribunal uses to make an adverse appraisal of the applicants case requires disclosure if the appraisal is a part of the reason for affirming the decision of the delegate My reservation with that submission concerns the interpolation of the expression appraisal in the context of the wording of s 424A1a  In any event in that context the appellants cited SZEEU at 20 and 34 per Moore J at 157165 per Weinberg J and at 221225 per Allsop J for the proposition that a subsidiary and minor part only of the reasons will suffice It suffices for me to point in particular to the dictum of Weinberg J at 164 to the effect that the information in question played a part  and to Moore Js reasons where his Honour used less definitive descriptions at 2021 The appellants asserted further that the conclusion that all three sets of reasons for the decision are affected by a breach of s 424A is readily determinable because the tribunal has clearly indicated in its reasons where and when it has obtained the information from the protection visa The appellants submissions continued that the tribunal made no disclosure of this adverse information and in accordance with the following principles as such the whole of the decision is affected by a breach of s 424AAs I have earlier foreshadowed the appellants argued that the Tribunals socalled first set of reasons constituted a breach of s 424A because the Tribunal used information given by the first appellant in his protection visa application as part of its reasons for affirming the decision of the Ministers delegate In the course of oral submissions counsel for the appellants pointed to the Tribunals reliance on information regarding the first appellants employment history place of residence and previous arrest warrants all being information gleaned from the first appellants application for a protection visa and which was purportedly used by the Tribunal in the formulation of its first set of reasons without the appellants being given prior particulars of that information as stipulated by s 424A1 That reliance of the Tribunal was undertaken in order to demonstrate differences or inconsistencies between information that the appellants had provided to the delegate of the Minister and the information subsequently given to the Tribunal being discrepancies that consequently formed the basis of the Tribunals finding that the first appellant had  exaggerated or fabricated his political activism and the situation of harm that he faced in Bangladesh In support of the contention that information given to the Ministers Department that is obtained by the Tribunal from the Department and not from an applicant for refugee status is not subject to the exception contained in s 424A3b and therefore falls within s 424A1 the appellants pointed to Merkel Js following observations at 4041 in Al Shamry    An applicant for a protection visa will have provided information relevant to the outcome of the application prior to applying for the review of a delegates decision further the information given may be supplemented by information provided subsequently to the Department or to the delegate of the Minister An applicant may have no record of the information provided but more importantly may not be aware of its significance to the review ultimately to be conducted by the RRT It is therefore understandable that the legislature would require that in fairness any adverse information provided prior to review the significance his Honours emphasis of which the applicant may be unaware be disclosed to the applicant to enable him or her to respond to it    For the above reasons the construction of the primary judge and I regard as correct gives effect to the beneficial purpose of s 424A of affording an applicant with the opportunity to respond to the gravamen or substance of any adverse information upon which the RRT proposes to act the significance of which the applicant may be unaware It is consistent with that purpose to take a narrow rather than a broad view of the exceptions in s 424A3 Given those observations of his Honour not being explicitly or implicitly inconsistent with the reasoning of the majority which I will assume for the purpose of the argument those observations underline the need for the appellant to be given particulars of any adverse information submitted prior to the application for review and on which the Tribunal proposes to relyFurther to the foregoing contention of the appellants it was next said on their behalf that SZEEU provides authority for the proposition that s 424A will be engaged in situations where the Tribunal finds as relevant to its reasoning some inconsistency or incompatibility between earlier information provided by an applicant and evidence provided thereafter by that applicant Weinberg J observed at 165 of SZEEU as follows   appellants credibility was of critical importance to his claim Any information that the Tribunal considered as casting serious doubt upon his credibility whether referred to in the early stages of its reasons or as fortifying its earlier conclusions seems to me likely to have played a part in the decision For that reason the Tribunals failure to provide the appellant with notice in writing of its intention to rely upon that information gave rise to a breach of s 424A and in accordance with SAAP  to jurisdictional error  By the expression intention to rely I assume that his Honour thereby referred to reliance in decisionmaking Moreover Allsop J said at 225 as follows     the Tribunal finds as relevant to its reasoning some inconsistency or incompatibility between earlier information and evidence to it as relevant to its reasoning that may well engage s 424A if such inconsistency or incompatibility can be seen to have been a part of the reason for affirming the decision  It should be here recorded that the Ministers submissions conceded that in the light of SZEEU  Nicholls FM may have erred in the first part of 28 where he seems to accept a distinction between relying upon inconsistencies to reach a conclusion rather than the underlying information However Nicholls FM went on to observe at 28 germane to the issues here arising for resolution as follows     I am also persuaded in the alternative that even if this part of the Tribunals decision did contain jurisdictional error it did not have necessary consequence in the ultimate decision to affirm the delegates decision For the reasons set out below the Tribunals decision can be upheld on the basis of other independent sets of reasons given by the Tribunal and that any such error if it does exist in this first set of the Tribunals reasons cannot be a basis for setting aside the Tribunals decision  His Honour referred in that regard to VEAJ  ante Counsel for the appellants in oral submissions further contended that the second and third sets of reasons see again 24 above were also affected by a breach of s 424A because they similarly relied upon information obtained from the appellants protection visa application The Tribunals statement that the appellant  did not leave Bangladesh until over two months after he obtained his Australian visa was asserted by the appellant to be one of the observations within the Tribunals second set of reasons that was based on information contained in the protection visa application and which was said by the appellants to have involved a breach of s 424A The appellants further contended that such a finding amounted to a part of the reason of the Tribunal  SZEEU at 158 per Weinberg J and at 225 per Allsop J being relied upon to support their argument that a minor and subsidiary part of the reasons is all that is needed for a breach of s 424A to arise There is some force in that submission by the appellantThe breach of s 424A that was said by the appellants to arise out of the Tribunals third set of reasons for decision see again 24 above was related to the first appellants claim that he would face legal action if he returned to Bangladesh In rejecting that claim the Tribunal member observed that i n terms of any legal action the applicant faces I note that he has not been convicted of a crime or any offence  The appellants submitted that the Tribunal relied on information contained in the first appellants protection visa application that indicated he had not been convicted of any crimes and that such a finding formed part of the Tribunals reason because it goes to an integer of the claim and is information which requires disclosure under section 424A The Minister contended that while the information regarding the first appellants previous criminal convictions is on the face of itsomething which the applicant said to DIMIA the subsequent statement made by the Tribunal suggested that independent country information formed the basis of the reasoning used to dispel the appellants claim regarding possible future criminal prosecution The Tribunal stated in that regard as follows   reasons given elsewhere in this decision I do not believe that his claim that he faces any cases false or otherwise is credible but if he does face a case or cases then I conclude from the country information on the judiciary on page 12 that he would eventually secure justice  The Minister submitted that because of that word  but  and reading that paragraph in context the Tribunal is saying well on the one hand I note that he has not been convicted of any crime or offence but then saying even if he had been then because of the independent country information on the judiciary no harm is going to come to him There is force in that submission of the Minister and upon reading that paragraph as a whole it would appear that the Tribunals reasoning was indeed based on independent country information rather than the first appellants application visa The Tribunals findings in relation to relocation contained in the final or third of the three sets of reasons were in any event not visited with jurisdictional error since they were based on country information that fell within the exception to disclosure contained in s 424A3bOn the footing of the appellants case that all three of the Tribunals socalled three good sets of reasons were to no avail because of the Ministers contraventions of s 424A of the Migration Act  the appellants asserted that  the determinative issue on appeal is whether there was unwarrantable delay on the part of the appellants disentitling them from the grant of relief I would interpolate the description ultimate for determination for what that may matter I have already summarised the evidentiary material bearing upon that issue of delay The appellants seemingly acknowledged that Nicholls FM found the delay unwarrantable because it was for a period of 13 months between notification of the decision of the tribunal and the application for review and further that his Honour found that no explanation for the delay was given despite being sought and moreover that the appellants were not unfamiliar with the application process and their delay  was inconsistent with the action of someone who fears persecution and claims to be aggrieved by the Tribunal So much may be in any event inferred from the evidence placed before his Honour The rejoinder of the appellants to those findings of the Tribunal was somewhat confusingly that Nicholls FM  miscarried in his discretion to not grant the relief sought because rather than ask whether the circumstances of the delay justified withholding the relief in the event that the appellants established that the tribunal had committed a jurisdictional error the Federal Magistrate proceeded on the basis that the appellants were required to satisfy the Court that the discretion should be exercised in their favour having regard to the fact that the delay exceeded 13 months The reality apparent from the objective circumstances was that the appellants had no viable answer to the Ministers case on delayIndependently of the factor of delay I am in any event of the opinion for reasons appearing cumulatively in the course of my consideration and appraisal already of the s 424A issues extensively raised by the appellants and debated seriatim by the respective parties being the issues I have already discussed at some length that the appellants have not established that all three of the Tribunals independent grounds for dismissing the appellants visa applications as articulated in the Tribunals three good sets of reasons breach s 424A of the Migration Act  Reference should again be made in that regard to SZEEU at 231 where Allsop J observed that where there can be shown an independent basis otherwise unimpeached upon which the decision was reached relief can be withheld The existence of the unimpeached third set of reasons of the Tribunals reasons for judgment thus operates as a basis upon which relief can be withheld regardless of any finding of unwarrantable delay In the present litigation the task of the second Tribunal in establishing and assigning significance to the extensive array of circumstances placed before it was a formidable one as the three grounds or sets of reasons of the Tribunal below extracted in 24 above have duly exemplifiedNo sufficient or adequate basis for any successful appeal from the reasons for decision of the Federal Magistrates Court have been established by the appellants for the reasons apparent from my analysis of the issues arising and circumstances prevailing and which I have addressed in the two preceding segments of these reasons Because of the number and extent of the issues raised by the appellants on this appeal and which I have resolved in favour of the Minister it is unnecessary to repeat the same in the context of these conclusionsThe appeal must be dismissed and the appellants ordered to pay the Ministers costs of the appeal  I certify that the preceding fiftyseven 57 numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Conti AssociateDated 18

06_1244.xml,c13,referred_to,SZHJR v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 203,Reliance was placed by the appellants upon what was said by Sackville J in SZHJR v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs 2006 FCA 203  where his Honour held at 19 and 22 as follows so far as is material   It seems to me that the Magistrate proceeded on an erroneous assumption namely that the appellant had to persuade the Court to exercise a discretion in his favour before it could consider whether the RRT had indeed committed a jurisdictional error The correct position was that the Magistrate had a discretion to withhold relief on various grounds including unjustified delay even if the appellant established that the RRTs decision was affected by a jurisdictional error   The difficulty with the approach of the Magistrate is that he did not ask whether the circumstances of the delay justified the withholding of relief in the event that the appellant established that the RRT had committed a jurisdictional error Rather the cases upon which he relied suggest that he required the appellant to satisfy the Court that discretion should be exercised in his favour having regard to the fact that the delay exceeded one year     On any view the appellant was guilty of long delay and no satisfactory excuse was or could be proffered for that delay But the question asked by the Magistrate in my view was not the correct one and this led to his miscarrying of this issue In my opinion and contrary to the thrust of the appellants submissions Nicholls FM did enquire as to whether the circumstance of the delay justified the withholding of the relief in the event that the appellants established that the Tribunal had committed a jurisdictional error and hence his Honour did meet the substance of the test as articulated by Sackville J above Nicholls FM invited the appellants to comment on why their application was delayed an invitation that ultimately led the first appellant to respond I have nothing to say regarding this matter His Honour proceeded thereafter to explore the issue of jurisdictional error Incidentally I do not understand Nicholls FM to have relied merely on the fact of 13 months per se but rather upon the circumstances which he had otherwise comprehensively reviewed in his reasons for judgment contextually to that delay

06_1244.xml,c17,discussed,SZGZW v Minister of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 457,Counsel for the appellant advanced the yet further submission that the manner in which the Federal Magistrate obtained the explanation for the delay from the appellant was not judicial because he took the information from the bar table It was submitted in that regard that by obtaining the husbandfathers explanation for the relevant delay in that manner the Federal Magistrate was putting himself in the position of an advocate or an inquisitor andthat that process was not sufficiently judicial In support of that submission reliance was placed on what appears from the unreported reasons for judgment of Jacobson J in SZGZW v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs 2006 FCA 457  where at 45 his Honour observed in relation to a delay of eight years from 1996 to 2005 in applying for review of an adverse Tribunal decision as follows   It follows from what I have said that the discretion to refuse relief miscarried within the well known principle stated in House v R 1936 HCA 40  1936 55 CLR 499 at 504505 It was not open to the learned Federal Magistrate to find that the appellants delay was lengthy or unsatisfactory upon the basis of untested statements made from the bar tableAside from whatever may have been the content of the untested statements made from the bar table in SZGZW  and irrespective of what the objective circumstances might have evinced in any event the context of the present case can be distinguished from that addressed by Jacobson J in SZGZW  in that his Honour was there addressing circumstances where the Tribunal had challenged an assertion made by the appellant upon the basis solely of statements made by that appellant from the bar table Jacobson J observed at 3940 and 41 of SZGZW so far as is material as follows    the difficulty with the approach which the Federal Magistrate adopted was that he made findings of fact without hearing any evidence from the appellant He acted solely upon submissions from the bar table and without testing any of the statements which were made to him by an unrepresented applicant    as a general rule the judicial power of the Commonwealth cannot be exercised to deny relief for admitted jurisdictional error consisting as it does in this case of a denial of statutory procedural fairness without evidence tested in the ordinary way     That is especially so in the present case because the learned Federal Magistrate apparently did not believe the explanation proffered from the bar table The appellants overall explanation for his delay was that he did not know of the decision until 28 November 2005 The Federal Magistrate cannot have believed this because he proceeded on the basis that the appellant knew of the decision either from 1996 or at least when the unsuccessful request was made under s 417 In the decision below Nicholls FM did rely upon the content of the appellants application and amended application filed with the Federal Magistrates Court when determining the issue of unwarrantable delay rather than merely  relying solely on submissions from the bar table  and his Honour invited the appellant to address or explain the delay otherwise prima facie objectively evident yet the appellants declined to provide any such explanation Nicholls FM stated at 9 of his reasons for decision as follows   the case before me the applicant clearly confirmed having notice of the Tribunal decision complained of on 21 May 2003 This is clearly stated both in the application and amended application The application to this Court was filed well over 13  months later on 14 July 2004 At the hearing before me I specifically drew the applicants attention to the issue of delay in bringing these proceedings to this Court and the possibility of how the discretion to grant or refuse the relief sought may be affected by this I urged the applicant to address or explain the delay The applicants response was   I wont say anything regarding this long period like 12 to 13 months delay I have nothing to say whatsoever    I pressed the issue he made a reference to some authority who made the delay But when I sought an explanation the final response was   I have nothing to say regarding this matter  I do not think that the observations of Jacobson J made in SZGZW may be transposed to the context in which this first appellant responded as above as recorded by Nicholls FM No factors or circumstances have been advanced by the appellants which would in my opinion operate to require the exercise of discretion in their favour upon any basis articulated on the appeal

06_1246.xml,c1,applied,Tringali v Stewardson Stubbs & Collett Pty Limited (1966) 66 SR NSW 335,I am of opinion that there is the power in the Court to impose conditions on a grant of leave to appeal in circumstances where like the present the appeal is interlocutory but there are other proceedings on foot the benefit of which the unsuccessful party seeks to maintain while at the same time seeking to challenge the result which would have the effect of negating the factual substratum underlying those other proceedings Such a power seems to me to fall within the inherent power of a superior court of record to condition orders that it makes inter partes to accord with the requirements of the demands of justice just as the power to grant a stay is not confined to closed categories of cases of which vexatious suits is one illustration It is a power which is exercisable in any situation where the requirements of justice demand it Tringali v Stewardson Stubbs  Collett Pty Limited 1966 66 SR NSW 335 at 344 The power to impose conditions should be similarly approached

06_1249.xml,c1,cited,Byron Environment Centre Inc v Arakwal People (1997) 78 FCR 1,The leading case on the range of interests which confer standing under the Act is Byron Environment Centre Inc v Arakwal People 1997 78 FCR 1 That case concerned the party provisions of the Act in effect before the 1998 amendments They were ss 68 and 69  The decision however remains authoritative for the similarly worded party provisions in s 84 In that decision the Full Court held that the interests which could be affected by a determination in relation to an application for native title and thus give rise to an entitlement to party status are not confined to the interests in land or waters which are referred to in s 253 of the ActBlack CJ held that the interest sufficient to give a person the right to become a party to an application should be greater than that of a member of the general public They must be genuine and the possible effect must be genuine The Parliament could not have contemplated that the rights given to persons as parties would have other than a genuine foundation His Honour said at 7   nature and content of the right to become a party to proceedings for the determination of native title with the power as a party in effect to veto the process of mediation and conciliation which the Act favours suggests that the interests with which s 682a and the related sections dealing with parties are concerned are interests that are not indirect remote or lacking substance The nature and content of the right also suggests that the interests must be capable of clear definition and equally importantly that they are of such a character that they may be affected in a demonstrable way by a determination in relation to the application  The requisite interest did not need to be proprietary legal or equitable He said at 7      the interests must be genuine and not indirect remote or lacking substance there is no indication that for example a person who has a special wellestablished nonproprietary connection with land or waters which is of significance to that person is not be regarded as having interests that may be affected by a determination To the contrary the consensual objects of the Act would seem to be advanced if a person with genuine interests of that nature that might or would be affected did have the rights of involvement in the process of native title determination given by the Act to a person who is a party Each case will of course turn on its own facts and whether or not interests will or may be affected will depend upon an assessment of the interaction between the interests asserted by a person who wants to be a party and the nature and extent of the native title rights and interests claimed  The concept of interest did not extend to interests of an emotional conscientious ideological or intellectual kind only Relevantly his Honour also said at 9      formation of an association or the incorporation of a body with particular objects will not of itself create interests that may be affected for the purposes of provisions in the Act relating to parties    a body that represents the interests of others whose members have interests that may be affected does not for that reason alone become a person whose interests are affected such interests as it thereby has are wholly indirect   is not to deny that a corporation may have interests that may be affected by a determination of native title if for example its activities might be curtailed or otherwise significantly affected by the determinationIn

native title determination in either sense of a proprietary or contractual interests in the land the subject of the application orb conducting activities which may be adversely affected by such a determination His Honour held following the judgments in Byron Environment Centre that a body that represents the interests of others whose members have interests that may be affected does not for

2   do not find it necessary to refer to the discussion of the matter in those cases beyond noting that they establish that a society organisation association or other body which voices protects or promotes the concerns and interests of its members does not by reason of that circumstance alone have interests which may be affected by a determination in the proceedings for the purposes of subs 845 of the Act  Applying that proposition to the position of the Chamber of Minerals and Energy of Western Australia his Honour refused its application for joinder See also Adnyamatha People v South Australia 2003 FCA 1377  2003 133 FCR 242 Mansfield JIt is clear from the authority of the Full Court decision in Byron Environment Centre that WAFIC cannot acquire party status by reason of the possible effects of a native title determination on the interests of its members It asserts however that it has an affected interest by reason of its participation in statutory committees advising government in relation to managed fisheries some of which exist in the claim area It does not appear to me however that this function carried out on the part of WAFIC can be compared to that of a statutory authority with direct responsibility for the management of an area the subject of a native title determination application WAFICs involvement as described in its submissions and supporting evidence seems to relate to advice to government on policy for the management of the relevant fisheries No evidence is shown which logically link the economic interests of WAFIC as an organisation to a native title determination in the claim area Nor am I satisfied that the evidence discloses any real basis upon which WAFICs capacity to participate in the committees to which it has referred would be affectedIn so saying I accept that WAFIC has been joined as party in some applications without any contention and has acted as agent in others It has played a valuable role in the submissions that it has made in such cases not least in the Bardi Jawi case which I heard as trial judge albeit WAFIC had been joined by order of Lee J In my opinion however I am bound by the authority in Byron Environment Centre to reject WAFICs application for joinder as a party It may of course act as agent on behalf of a party in relation to the proceeding That does not require the intervention of the Court Under s 84B a party to a proceeding can appoint an organisation as its agent WAFICs application for joinder is therefore refusedThe same considerations arise in relation to the Ngarla Peoples claim and again WAFICs application for joinder in that claim will be refusedI note that among the proposals for amendments to the Act arising out of the recent Commonwealth Government review is a proposal under which industry bodies could be joined as parties In my opinion provided that their participation is confined to the representation of their member interest holders in matters directly relevant to the impact of a native title determination on those interests then the capacity to effect such a joinder may be a useful facility

06_125.xml,c4,applied,Jackson v Wells (1985) 5 FCR 296,5 In a letter dated 3 December 2004 the Australian Government Solicitor invited Mr Hopper to comment on the following matters    3 In order to assist the AttorneyGeneral to reconsider his previous decision not to consent to a representative of the applicant being present during the closed hearing we therefore invite you to address the following matters     31 The fact that whatever the safeguards your access to the certificated material is an encroachment upon its confidentiality  Commonwealth v Northern Land Council 1993 HCA 24  199293 176 CLR 604 at 620     32 The risk of you disclosing inadvertently or otherwise sensitive ASIO information to your client one of your other clients or another person      a You have represented or currently represent a number of members of the Islamic community in Sydney who have been the subject of investigation by ASIO In the present case some of the documents refer to other individuals who are also current or former clients of yours The risk of inadvertent disclosure is increased because it may not be selfevident to you that asking a particular apparently benign question of your client or other persons could reveal to your client or the other persons some aspect of the certificated material       b The risk of inadvertent disclosure of national security information has been recognised by Courts without reflecting in any way upon the integrity of the particular legal representative The risk may increase with the volume of material the complexity and protractedness of the legal proceedings and the passage of time Once the certificated material became part of your general knowledge it may be difficult for you to recall its source and ensure nondisclosure       c As noted by Justice Wilcox in Jackson v Wells 5 FCR 296 It seems  merely commonsense to conclude that the fewer people who have access to confidential information the less is the risk of unauthorised disclosure     33 The potentially serious consequences if such disclosure occurred      a Disclosure of the certificated information and related submissions would also result in the disclosure to others of ASIOs modus operandi and ongoing investigations The ongoing maintenance of confidentiality of ASIO sources of information and modus operandi is essential for ASIO to carry out its functions including ASIOs ability to provide advice to the Australian government on matters relating to security   b Disclosure of modus operandi and details of ongoing investigations could alert targets and thereby enable them to take counter intelligence steps which could adversely affect ASIOs ability to gather useful and important intelligence   c Disclosure of the certificated material could reveal to Mr Traljesic and other current or prospective targets of ASIOs areas of interest and the extent of its ability or effectiveness in obtaining intelligence      34 The extent to which your being present when the certificated evidence is given or submissions are made is likely to assist your client You may be able to make submissions about such things as the likely reliability plausibility or relevance of evidence given or submissions made that could affect the weight the Tribunal would attach to such evidence or submissions You would not however be able to tell your client anything which would disclose certificated evidence or related submissions This prohibition may well mean that your client will not be able to adduce any responsive evidence6 On 12 December 2004 Mr Hopper responded to the Attorneys invitation in the following terms  We refer to the above and your correspondence of 3 December 2004 We are obliged for the opportunity to address the concerns raised by the Attorney General in relation to certificated material   We make the following submissions in reply to your correspondence and adopt your paragraph numbering for clarity    31 It is quite clear to the writer that certified materials are highly sensitive to the interests of national security and access to such materials by the writer is acknowledged as an encroachment upon their confidentiality     As such the writer recognises the special responsibility placed on him if access is permitted Nonetheless the immunity sought by the Attorney General is subject to a competing interest being the proper administration of justice     In the particular case the interest of the proper administration of justice is superior as our client has had the right of international travel denied based on serious allegations contained in the ASIO security assessment This administrative decision has been made on the basis of this adverse security assessment     A significant portion of the evidence in support of the security assessment is subject to a certificate restricting access to it For our client to obtain even the basic level of procedural fairness and natural justice it is imperative that the writer who holds the appropriate security clearance be permitted access to certified material and be permitted to make submissions to the Tribunal at in camera hearings     32 The writer submits that the risk of a willful or inadvertent disclosure is nonexistent    a The writer acknowledges that he has represented a number of clients subject to ASIO investigations in the past and currently The writer represents 3 clients in passport cases and one in a civil litigation The writer further represents another client held in Guantanamo Bay but has not communicated with this client   The writer has also represented and provided legal advise sic to a number of other people who have been sic subject of ASIO investigations but for various reasons does not represent such people anymore and is unlikely to have any further contact with all but a few of these former client sic    From representing such clients the writer has a significant understanding of various methods employed by ASIO during investigations   As a consequence the writer is acutely aware of sensitivities related to such knowledge obtained and to providing appropriate lawful advice to clients subject to ASIO scrutiny without compromising the interests of national security   In the present case the writers experience in dealing with matters of national security would assist him in ensuring no deliberate or inadvertent disclosure of certified material would occur   The writer has discussed the matter of accessing certified material with Mr Traljesic and other relevant active clients of this practice in Australia and advised them that he would not be able to disclose any certified material to them    Further the writer has advised these clients that when he is attending to one clients matter he may obtain information from certified material attending relating to another client and would not be able to disclose the information to either client These clients instructed the writer that they understood this and had no objections if such were the case   Accordingly there would be no expectation by the clients for the writer to disclose any certified material to them   The clients are also aware that if any information exposes a conflict of interest then the writer will have to cease to act for those whom the conflict applies   b The writer understands the importance of retaining a clear knowledge of the source of information related to national security as a strategy to prevent inadvertent disclosure    The writer will always and has always checked the source of information prior to disclosure if there is any uncertainty as to the informations source   c The writer acknowledges the obita dicta in Jackson v Wells and submits that the writer being permitted access to certified material and in camera hearings is entirely consistent with the principle   The writer has the appropriate security clearance and as he represents a number of clients with such matters any information would be restricted to the one person This has to be advantageous to a situation where numerous persons had separate representatives   It should be further noted that disclosure of any certified information to any source would be a serious ethical breach of the solicitors practice rules and would be reportable to the Law Society A significant possibility would exist that the writer would be struck off the role of solicitors if a deliberate or negligent disclosure of certified information was made    The writer takes very seriously his role as an officer of the court and is aware that his duty to the court outweighs that to his clients     33 The writer is well aware of the serious consequences of a deliberate or inadvertent disclosure of certified information   a The writer acknowledges that disclosure of sources of information being persons documents or devices would seriously prejudice the operations of ASIO and the interests of national security   The writer is aware that the disclosure of the name of a person who is a source of information to ASIO would place that person at significant risk of harm   Given these sensitivities the writer understands that he would have a special responsibility not to disclose sources of information The writer undertakes not to disclose sources of information of ASIO and to employ the highest degree of prudence to ensure that no inadvertent disclosure occurs   b The writer undertakes not to disclose any information obtained from certified information regarding the modus operandi of ASIO and details about ongoing operations to any person or client   The writer is aware of the nature of counter intelligence and would be extremely prudent with any certified information obtained to prevent it being disclosed and used to undermine the efforts of ASIO and other relevant authorities   c The writer acknowledges the Governments concerns in this paragraph It is the writers role to represent clients legally and not assist them in activities that may be detrimental to the national security or to otherwise offend the laws of Australia   Accordingly the writer is aware that disclosure of certified material could be of great prejudice to ASIO and the national interest As such the writer undertakes not to deliberately disclose certified information and employ the highest degree of prudence to avoid inadvertent disclosure of such information    34 The writer acknowledges that we would not be able to disclose any certified information obtained from documents or in camera proceedings to any client counsel or other person     Without prior knowledge of the material we cannot submit specifically to what extent the writer can assist our client     Notwithstanding that the writer agrees that he can assist as you have outlined in paragraph 34 Furthermore the writer has a significant understanding of the clients mindset social background culture and his philosophy toward Islam This information may well assist our client in relation to any analysis of his comments by ASIO or others     The writers presence would also ensure that our client was treated fairly in relation to the admission of evidence and submissions by the Government This is significant in the circumstances as the client cannot be present and is up against a well resourced Government that has taken action to restrict his right to international travel based on serious allegations that have criminal undertones    Summary   The writer has been involved in matters involving ASIO and national security since October 2001 This has involved providing advice to numerous clients instigating court and tribunal proceedings and public comment The writer is one of the few nongovernment lawyers who has obtained a security clearance that is at the appropriate level to have access to certified material   There are competing interests at stake in this matter That of the public interest to maintain national security over that of the proper administration of justice Given the resources of the Government and the fact that our client is not permitted access to certified information or in camera proceedings the interest of the proper administration of justice is superior This is buttressed by the writers exposure to national security matters and the acute awareness of the sensitivities of restricted information and the consequences that would flow from its disclosure   The writer undertakes that any certified information will not be disclosed to the client the clients counsel or any other person other than strictly authorised by the Government The writer further undertakes to employ the highest degree of prudence to prevent inadvertent disclosure of certified information   The writer is aware that disclosure of certified information would constituted a serious ethical breach of the solicitors practice rules and such breach would likely involve disciplinary action that may well see the offending practitioner struck off from the role of solicitors7 On 9 March 2005 the Australian Government Solicitor responded to the letter of 12 December 2004 stating that they were advised that the AttorneyGeneral   a has now reconsidered all relevant matters in relation to his decision under section 39A9 including but not limited to the submissions made in your letter of 12 December 2004   b does not consent to your  that is Mr Hopper  being present when evidence is adduced or submissions made which are the subject of the certificates issued pursuant to section 39A8 of the AAT Act in the proceedings8 A certificate signed by the AttorneyGeneral subsequently issued dated 19 April 2005 in the following terms  ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS TRIBUNAL ACT 1975  ABDULLAH TRALJESIC  CERTIFICATE ISSUED BY THE ATTORNEYGENERAL  UNDER SECTIONS 36 39A AND 39B   I Philip Ruddock the AttorneyGeneral for the Commonwealth of Australia and the Minister administering the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979  hereby certify pursuant to paragraph 39B2a of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 the Act that disclosure of the contents of the documents described in the supplementary schedules hereto and the schedules would be contrary to the public interest because the disclosure would prejudice security   I further certify pursuant to subsection 39A8 of the Act that evidence proposed to be adduced and submissions proposed to be made by or on behalf of the DirectorGeneral of Security concerning the documents set out in the Supplementary Schedules hereto are of such a nature that the disclosure of the evidence or submissions would be contrary to the public interest because it would prejudice security   As the responsible Minister for the purposes of subsections 39A8 and 9 of the Act I do not consent to a person representing the Applicant being present when evidence described in paragraph 2 is adduced and such submissions are made   I further certify pursuant to subsection 361 of the Act that disclosure of the contents of the public interest by reason that it would prejudice the security of Australia23 Once that occurs by in effect persons putting two and two together the damage is done and cannot be undone In circumstances where the security of the nation has been confided by statute to a Minister of the Crown who forms a view that there is a risk to security by a revelation of information I do not consider that it is an irrelevant consideration for the Minister to have regard to an assessment of risk even of remote risk in circumstances where the person who is applying as in this case to have information revealed to him or her could be put into the position where inadvertently and through no design of his or her own he or she will unconsciously reveal something of importance which may be of no meaning to him or her In Jackson v Wells 1985 5 FCR 296 at pp 307308 Wilcox J said this   Thirdly Mr Roberts suggested that if I were not disposed to grant access to the subject material to the parties I should at least grant access to the legal representatives of the parties I gave this submission anxious consideration It was a course apparently considered by the High Court in Alister v The Queen 1983 HCA 45  1984 154 CLR 404  although ultimately not adopted As I have indicated I would have welcomed the assistance of counsel upon the content of the documents The applicants would no doubt have felt more satisfied that the documents were rigorously examined by the court if their counsel had been given the opportunity to take the court through the documents But in the end I rejected the proposal It involves a number of problems Without reflecting in any way upon the integrity of any counsel or solicitor difficulties are likely to arise where counsel appearing in and advising their clients in respect of protracted and complex proceedings acquire information which they are not free to use or to pass on to their clients During the heat of battle an unwitting disclosure may occur Frank and full advice becomes impossible I am aware of cases in which for reasons such as these experienced counsel have declined to receive information which they are not free to share with their clients It seems to me merely commonsense to conclude that the fewer people who have access to confidential information the less is the risk of unauthorised disclosure Weighing the assistance likely to be obtained from counsels submissions against the sensitivity of the material it seemed better not to accede to Mr Roberts suggestion

state of mind case was an appeal to the High Court in its original jurisdiction against an objection decision It concerned the deductibility of past years losses In order to be entitled to a deduction a taxpayer had to establish certain things for convenience I will use the expression continuity of beneficial ownership to the satisfaction of the Commissioner ITAA s 805 Dixon J stated at 360  But it is for the commissioner not for me to be satisfied of the state of the voting power at the end of the year of income His decision it is true is not unexaminable If he does not address himself to the question which the subsection formulates if his conclusion is affected by some mistake of law if he takes some extraneous reason into consideration or excludes from consideration some factor which should affect his determination on any of these grounds his conclusion is liable to review Moreover the fact that he has not made known the reasons why he was not satisfied will not prevent the review of his decision The conclusion he has reached may on a full consideration of the material that was before him be found to be capable of explanation only on the ground of some misconception44 There was no reference to s 1771 or s 190b Nonetheless Dixon J may be taken to have accepted   that it was open to the taxpayer to prove the excessiveness of the assessment by showing that the Commissioners not being satisfied as to continuity of beneficial ownership could not stand on judicial review grounds and  that if it was established that at law the Commissioner had been bound to be satisfied the taxpayer would be entitled to the deduction for past years losses45 Avon Downs does not address the question whether the Commissioner could be required to give particulars It appears however that Dixon J contemplated that the taxpayer would have to proceed on the basis that the Commissioner was not obliged to disclose his reasons but that the taxpayer would have available the materials that had been before the Commissioner67 Like Avon Downs  Commissioner of Taxation v Brian Hatch Timber Co Sales Pty Ltd 1971 HCA 18  1972 128 CLR 28  Brian Hatch  concerned the carry forward loss provisions A necessary condition of deductibility under s 80A of the ITAA was the taxpayer companys satisfying the Commissioner concerning continuity of beneficial ownership a state of mind case At first instance Walsh J upheld the taxpayers appeal applying the passage from Dixon Js judgment in Avon Downs  The only material before the Commissioner that was before his Honour was the taxpayers return and a record of interview In substance Walsh J held that on this slim material the Commissioner had not been entitled not to be satisfied of continuity of beneficial ownership68 In allowing an appeal all members of the Full Court also referred to Dixon J in Avon Downs  but considered that the taxpayer had not established any of the grounds to which Dixon J had referred In other words so far as the evidence led by the taxpayer showed the Commissioner had been entitled not to be satisfied69 Barwick CJ said at 45 that the primary Judge had rightly regarded the Commissioners lack of satisfaction as examinable on Avon Downs grounds noting that the taxpayer had not taken the course of seeking from the Commissioner an account of the material upon which he acted in rejecting the claim to the deduction at 45 The Chief Justice added that it was unsatisfactory that the Commissioner had not led evidence of any matter that he had before him It is implicit I think that Barwick CJ thought that the taxpayer would have been entitled to particulars of the material that was before the Commissioner and perhaps of the matters he had taken into account70 Menzies J likewise thought it unfortunate that the basis of the Commissioners not being satisfied of what was requisite for allowing the deduction claimed was not revealed at 52 His Honour noted that the taxpayer might properly have inquired of the Commissioner why he was not satisfied and observed that such an inquiry would no doubt have been answered ibid71 Windeyer J pointed out at 56 that the question was not whether a discretion was properly exercised but whether a fact existed did the taxpayer in fact satisfy the Commissioner of beneficial ownership as prescribed by s 80A72 Owen J with whom Windeyer J agreed noted that the taxpayer had not taken various courses that had been open to it one of which was to inquire of the Commissioner what matters he had considered in disallowing the deduction claimed or why he had not been satisfied about the state of the shareholding at the relevant times at 5960 Again it seems clear that in their Honours view the Commissioner would have been compellable to answer such inquiries78 Barwick CJ dissented His Honour said at 541 that the Commissioner should have recorded his relevant state of mind and the facts or his view of the facts on which it is based and that it should not be left to the Court to draw inferences as to whether he had considered a matter The Chief Justice added citing his own judgment in Giris  that the Commissioner must expose to the taxpayer particularly if so requested  both his state of mind at the relevant time and its basis at 541 emphasis added Like the majority and Windeyer J in Brian Hatch  his Honour saw the issue as being one of fact was the Commissioner in fact satisfied at the point of assessment or not His Honour disagreed with the majority however as to the Commissioners right to support his state of dissatisfaction at the time by a course of reasoning devised later80 All Judges accepted that the Commissioners state of nonsatisfaction was reviewable on Avon Downs grounds However none of the judgments referred to the interaction between ss 1771 or s 190b of the ITAA83 Aickin J delivered the leading judgment Barwick CJ and Gibbs Mason and Jacobs JJ expressed agreement with his Honours reasons His Honour said that the particulars sought were necessary so that the case would proceed in an orderly and comprehensible manner at 227 His Honour thought that it was not in the interests of the proper administration of justice that on the hearing the appellant should have to speculate about and adduce evidence to negate every possible kind of agreement or arrangement and avoidance which the imagination of his advisers can conjure up ibid It did not matter that s 260 was selfexecuting and did not depend on the Commissioners forming an opinion or reaching a state of satisfaction With his Honours approach may be contrasted that of Kitto J in George see 47 above84 Barwick CJ referred to s 190b His Honour stated that if some step in the process of assessment lacked the authority of the Act the assessment would be shown to be excessive His Honour continued at 217  I have elsewhere indicated and now confirm that in my opinion it is that process which must be exposed to the Court and with which the Court is exclusively concerned in an appeal by the taxpayer  The Chief Justice stated ibid Quite clearly the taxpayer is entitled to know the basis on which the assessment has been made85 In this case again Barwick CJ expressed himself in favour of disclosure and particularisation by the Commissioner However apparently his Honour contemplated only a brief particularisation of the assessment by the Commissioner He said at 218 that a statement by the Commissioner in his adjustment sheet of the assessable income as determined by him would be a sufficient compliance with  his obligation in informing the taxpayer of the basis of the assessment105 His Honour observed   1 at 469470 that s 177F fell into that category where an opinion formed by the Commissioner or a determination by him or his state of mind is made a crucial element in the process of assessment citing Bailey at 225 Aickin J 2 at 470 that the assessment would be excessive if some step in the Commissioners process of ascertainment of the amount of tax lacked the authority of the ITAA citing Bailey at 217 Barwick CJ and 3 at 470 that a determination by the Commissioner under s 177F would lack the authority of the ITAA if inter alia  the Commissioner had regard to irrelevant considerations or omitted to have regard to relevant ones citing Avon Downs at 360 Dixon J  It will be noted that Gummow J did not distinguish between state of mind cases and Commissioners determination cases both belonged to the same category at 469 Consistently his Honour considered that a determination would lack the authority of the ITAA just as a state of mind would do if defective on judicial review grounds119 The distinction between state of mind cases and Commissioners determination cases was referred to by the High Court in Commissioner of Taxation v Peabody 1994 HCA 43  1994 181 CLR 359  Peabody  a Part IVA case In a joint judgment all seven members of the High Court stated at 382  Under s 177F1 the Commissioners discretion to cancel a tax benefit extends only to a tax benefit obtained in connexion with a scheme to which Pt IVA applies The existence of the discretion is not made to depend upon the Commissioners opinion or satisfaction that there is a tax benefit or that if there is a tax benefit it is obtained in connexion with a Pt IVA scheme Those are posited as objective facts citing McAndrew at 276277 Kitto J and referring to Avon Downs at 360 Dixon J  The erroneous identification by the Commissioner of a scheme as being one to which Pt IVA applies or a misconception on his part as to the connexion of a tax benefit with such a scheme will result in the wrongful exercise of the discretion conferred by s 177F1 only if in the event the tax benefit which the Commissioner purports to cancel is not a tax benefit within the meaning of Pt IVA That is unlikely to be the case if the error goes to the mere detail of a scheme relied upon by the Commissioner An error of a more fundamental kind however may have that result where for example it leads to the identification of the wrong taxpayer as the recipient of the tax benefit But the question in every case must be whether a tax benefit which the Commissioner has purported to cancel is in fact a tax benefit obtained in connexion with a Pt IV A scheme and so susceptible to cancellation at the discretion of the Commissioner emphasis added The erroneous identification and misconception to which their Honours referred might be compared to an erroneous identification by the Commissioner of the international agreement in question in the present case The error may or may not vitiate the Commissioners exercise of his discretion determining that subss 136AD1 or 2 as the case may be is to apply in relation to the Taxpayers in relation to the supply of property128 Mason CJ observed at 178 that the making of a determination under s 177F forms part of the process of assessment and goes to the ascertainment of the substantive liability of the taxpayer to tax  emphasis in original His Honour referred to the distinction recognised in George  McAndrew  FJ Bloemen and Dalco  between the procedural mechanism by which taxable income is ascertained on the one hand and the taxpayers substantive liability on the other the former alone involving the due making of the assessment at 182184 After referring to certain illustrations of the distinction the Chief Justice observed at 184   the making of a determination by the Commissioner under s 177F of the ITAA is a determination going to substantive liability and in conformity with the interpretation of s 1771 adopted in George  McAndrew  FJ Bloemen and Dalco  is put in issue by an appeal which challenges the assessment on the ground that it is excessive  Later Mason CJ referred specifically to the susceptibility of a determination under s 177F to attack in an appeal to this Court against an objection decision His Honour stated at 1878  In such an appeal it is for the taxpayer to show that the assessment is excessive In that context the existence of an inadmissible purpose on the part of the Commissioner plays no part The central element of the legislative rgime is the making of an assessment by the Commissioner which ascertains the taxpayers liability to tax and the reference to the Tribunal or the appeal to the Federal Court in which the taxpayer is entitled to dispute his or her substantive liability to tax In such an appeal the taxpayer is at liberty to challenge the exercise of any relevant discretion by the Commissioner Thus on appeal the court will set aside the assessment if any relevant exercise of discretion by the Commissioner is affected by error of law if he has taken an extraneous factor into account or if he has failed to consider a material factor citing Avon Downs at 360 emphasis added154 The position established by Peabody see 119 above Sleight see 136 145 above and Syngenta see 146 150 above seems to be that a distinction is to be drawn between cases in which the ITAA specifies a state of mind on which the assessment of the amount of taxable income and tax depends cf Avon Downs  George  Giris  Duggan  Brian Hatch  Kolotex  WA Capital  Dalco  and those in which it specifies not a state of mind but the making of a determination as the event on which the amount of taxable income and tax depends cf Jackson  Peabody  Richard Walter  Binetter Sleight  Syngenta  In the latter class of case the legislature is taken to indicate that the interaction between s 1771 of the ITAA and s 14ZZOb of the TAA produces the result that the Commissioners state of mind on the basis of which the determination was made is part of the due making of the assessment and cannot be put in issue by the taxpayer

at 221 Jacobs J 227 231 Aickin J  Bailey 82 A question of the Commissioners liability to supply particulars arose in Bailey  The Commissioner had relied on the then general antiavoidance rule in s 260 of the ITAA The Court ordered him to provide particulars of the arrangement he alleged was rendered void against him by s 26086 A little confusingly at times the judgments in Bailey contain references to both particulars of the assessment and particulars of the Commissioners case to be raised on the hearing The adjustment sheet which accompanied the notice of assessment showed that the Commissioner had included the taxpayers proportion 77235 of a distribution of 411920 by Bailey Holdings Pty Ltd In the course of correspondence the Commissioner informed the taxpayer that he was relying on s 260 in including that amount The particulars ordered to be provided were further particulars of the distribution and particulars of the arrangement said to be within s 260 Thus the order was for further particulars of matters that the Commissioner had already positively asserted as having formed part of his assessment87 There is no suggestion that the Commissioner would not have been permitted to identify the arrangement concerned in alternative ways or to amend later the particulars given of the arrangement subject to any special order as to costs88 Bailey was neither a state of mind nor a Commissioners determination class of case I understand Bailey  like Master Butchers  as a case concerned with the practical running of a trial It does not determine the question whether the Commissioner should be ordered to provide particulars not of positive assertions made by him but of his thought processes antecedent to a positive statutorily required step that he does assert the making of a determination89 The judgments in Bailey do not refer to s 1771 and make only passing reference to s 190b105 His Honour observed   1 at 469470 that s 177F fell into that category where an opinion formed by the Commissioner or a determination by him or his state of mind is made a crucial element in the process of assessment citing Bailey at 225 Aickin J 2 at 470 that the assessment would be excessive if some step in the Commissioners process of ascertainment of the amount of tax lacked the authority of the ITAA citing Bailey at 217 Barwick CJ and 3 at 470 that a determination by the Commissioner under s 177F would lack the authority of the ITAA if inter alia  the Commissioner had regard to irrelevant considerations or omitted to have regard to relevant ones citing Avon Downs at 360 Dixon J  It will be noted that Gummow J did not distinguish between state of mind cases and Commissioners determination cases both belonged to the same category at 469 Consistently his Honour considered that a determination would lack the authority of the ITAA just as a state of mind would do if defective on judicial review grounds112 The primary Judge held that in the absence of an affirmative statement by the Commissioner the taxpayer was not entitled to particulars However the Full Court Pincus Gummow Lee JJ disagreed Their Honours thought that Bailey  which they described as the leading case on this subject was inconsistent with the general proposition that if the Commissioner intimates that he will not call any evidence about a matter necessary to the validity of his assessment but will simply argue at the trial that the taxpayer had not displaced the assessment particulars of its basis would ordinarily not be ordered at 191 They said no trace of such a doctrine can be found in the reasons in Bailey 113 Their Honours conceded as the primary Judge had implied that if the particulars sought were ordered that might enable the taxpayer to win an otherwise unwinnable case However they thought that particulars should have been ordered having regard to the fact that the holding of the opinion was itself made a condition of the validity of the assessment and that the covering letter had made further examination of that opinion a legitimate subject of inquiry114 The case can be distinguished from the present one on the ground that the ITAA does not make the Commissioners state of mind on any matter a condition of the power to make either the par d determinations or the subs 4 determination and therefore a condition of liability to tax Whether that is a satisfactory ground of distinction is another matter see 155 below120 Following the passage noted above their Honours continued by noting that the Commissioner may be required to supply particulars of the scheme relied on they cited Bailey  but was entitled to put his case in alternative ways I suggest by identifying different schemes in the alternative provided no undue embarrassment or surprise was caused to the taxpayer Even after a scheme had been particularised they noted at 382383 the position might be cured by amendment provided the interests of justice allowed such a course citing Bailey at 219121 Their Honours did not refer to the question of defects in the process of the making of the discretionary determination under s 177F except in the one respect mentioned in the passage quoted above

183 CLR 168  Richard Walter  in substance the Commissioner made two determinations under s 177F on the same day in respect of the same tax benefit one that the amount be included in the assessable income of Richard Walter Pty Ltd the taxpayer and the other that it be included in the assessable income of Morlea Professional Services Pty Ltd Morlea The taxpayer appealed to this Court against the disallowance of its objection123 The Deputy Commissioner sued to recover the unpaid tax in the Supreme Court of New South Wales The taxpayer sought in this Court an injunction under s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 Cth the Judiciary Act  restraining him from proceeding with that action In the s 39B proceeding the Deputy Commissioner moved for dismissal on the ground that upon production of the notice of the assessment s 1771 of the ITAA had the effect that this Court lacked jurisdiction to grant relief under s 39B The Commissioners motion was removed to the High Court124 In the High Court upon a stated case there was reserved for consideration by the Full Court the question raised by the motion137 The primary Judge RD Nicholson held  Sleight v Commissioner of Taxation 2003 53 ATR 667 at 697 that the making of a s 177F determination was part of the process of making the assessment  and not liable to challenge in this proceeding save in respect of matters going to substantive liability Richard Walter at CLR 178 203 His Honour held that it followed that any deficiency was validated by s 175 For this last proposition his Honour referred to Richard Walter at 182 1878 1935 1967 1989 209211 2223 and 2402 Finally his Honour noted that no argument had been made that the case fell within the conditions delineated in R v Hickman 139 Hill J whose eminence in this field is beyond question delivered the leading judgment His Honour held that a taxpayer cannot challenge a determination under s 177F on the ground that the Commissioner had erred in the making of the determination for example by failing to take into account a relevant consideration His Honour was clear in his view that ss 175 and 1771 produced this result He referred to George at 207 see 49 above and Richard Walter at 184 Mason CJ see 128 above Of the latter passage Hill J stated at 237  In other words it is not open to a taxpayer to challenge an assessment under Pt IVA by showing some error in the making of that determination  His Honour found support in the fact that in Richard Walter their Honours held that the question in every case was whether there was a tax benefit obtained in connection with a Pt IVA scheme susceptible to cancellation by the Commissioner Hill J added at 238   The question whether the Commissioners discretion sic decision as to whether there was a scheme to which Part IVA applied miscarried is thus not an issue in an appeal Rather the issue will be relevant to the present appeal whether the determination having been made there was a scheme to which the provisions of Part IVA applied and if so whether there was a tax benefit obtained in connection with that scheme These will be matters of fact and the burden will lie on the taxpayer to show that objectively there was no scheme in connection with which the taxpayer obtained a tax benefit If the taxpayer satisfies that burden he or she will have shown the assessment was excessive That will not be shown by the taxpayer demonstrating that the person who made the determination in some way erred in making it so that the discretion conferred upon the Commissioner miscarried142 With respect however their Honours appear to have found the result to be more clearly dictated by the authorities and in particular by Richard Walter  than I have found it to be It is not clear to me why the passage from the judgment of Mason CJ in Richard Walter at 184 set out in 128 above establishes that in an appeal it is not open to the taxpayer to challenge the making of a determination on judicial review grounds Moreover there is no reference to the passage from the judgment of Mason CJ at 1878 also set out at 128 above the primary Judge RD Nicholson J did refer to that passage but did not discuss it There is no reference either to Gummow Js answer to the second separate question in Jackson see 104 106 above or admittedly less relevantly to WA Capital see 107 114 above143 Hill J also said at 237 that Richard Walter was consistent with what the High Court said in Peabody at 382 the passage set out at 119 above I respectfully agree that that passage in Peabody does favour the view that the only basis on which a determination by the Commissioner under s 177F and it would follow determinations by him under s 136AD could be challenged even in an appeal is the nonfulfilment of the statutorily specified conditions precedent to the enlivening of the discretion and I suggest the Hickman principle152 I am concerned with an appeal under Pt IVC of the TAA that is to say a proceeding in which production of the Commissioners notice of assessment is not conclusive evidence as to the amount or particulars of the assessment yet is conclusive as to the due making of the assessment in other respects Cases such as FJ Bloemen and Richard Walter are distinguishable on their facts as not being in the nature of appeals154 The position established by Peabody see 119 above Sleight see 136 145 above and Syngenta see 146 150 above seems to be that a distinction is to be drawn between cases in which the ITAA specifies a state of mind on which the assessment of the amount of taxable income and tax depends cf Avon Downs  George  Giris  Duggan  Brian Hatch  Kolotex  WA Capital  Dalco  and those in which it specifies not a state of mind but the making of a determination as the event on which the amount of taxable income and tax depends cf Jackson  Peabody  Richard Walter  Binetter Sleight  Syngenta  In the latter class of case the legislature is taken to indicate that the interaction between s 1771 of the ITAA and s 14ZZOb of the TAA produces the result that the Commissioners state of mind on the basis of which the determination was made is part of the due making of the assessment and cannot be put in issue by the taxpayer

comprised two appeals heard together from decisions of the New South Wales Court of Appeal FJ Bloemen Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation unreported and Dorney v Commissioner of Taxation and Simons v Commissioner of Taxation 1980 1 NSWLR 404  Dorney and Simons  The appeal against the Commissioners objection decision in the FJ Bloemen proceeding was heard by Rath J 1978 36 FLR 191 However by reason of the judgments which that Court had in meanwhile delivered in the Dorney and Simons appeals the Court of Appeal dismissed the FJ Bloemen appeal Thus the reasons of the Court of Appeal are to be found in the Dorney and Simons appeals95 The question raised on the appeal to the High Court in FJ Bloemen was stated by Mason and Wilson JJ in their Honours joint judgment to be whether the Supreme Court of New South Wales in a statutory appeal under the ITAA or in a proceeding for declaratory relief has jurisdiction to determine that an assessment of the taxpayer to income tax under s 166 of the ITAA is invalid notwithstanding that a notice of assessment is produced by the Commissioner and that the notice has the force of conclusive evidence except in proceedings on appeal against the assessment under s 177 Their Honours noted at 365 that the case presented by the taxpayers had been that the Commissioner did not in truth make final assessments but purported to make assessments which if made at all were only tentative or provisional in neither case being authorised by the ITAA In the FJ Bloemen case the taxpayer also contended that the Commissioner had not made his assessments from the return or from any other information in his possession in accordance with s 166 and that his real purpose was not to assess the amount of taxable income or of the tax payable thereon but to cause a debt for tax to come into existence so that he could exercise his powers under s 218 of the ITAA at 36536696 In the High Court the taxpayers argued that s 1771 was enlivened only where something amounting to an assessment had been made and that production of a notice of assessment did not preclude inquiry into whether that condition was satisfied However the Court unanimously rejected the submission Mason and Wilson JJ with whom Stephen J agreed said that upon production of a notice of assessment that was final and definitive on its face as distinct from provisional or tentative the notice was conclusive evidence that an assessment was actually made not merely conclusive evidence that an assessment if made was duly made at 37897 The High Court judgments in FJ Bloemen do not assist greatly in the present appeals98 Part IVA was introduced into the ITAA by Act No 110 of 1981 replacing s 260 as the ITAAs general antiavoidance rule Div 13s more specific antiavoidance provision was introduced the following year as complementary to Pt IVA see 13 above Part IVA and Div 13 are similarly structured Unlike the former s 260 they both provide for the making of determinations by the Commissioner as conditions of liability to tax None of the cases considered above were of such a Commissioners determination class of case128 Mason CJ observed at 178 that the making of a determination under s 177F forms part of the process of assessment and goes to the ascertainment of the substantive liability of the taxpayer to tax  emphasis in original His Honour referred to the distinction recognised in George  McAndrew  FJ Bloemen and Dalco  between the procedural mechanism by which taxable income is ascertained on the one hand and the taxpayers substantive liability on the other the former alone involving the due making of the assessment at 182184 After referring to certain illustrations of the distinction the Chief Justice observed at 184   the making of a determination by the Commissioner under s 177F of the ITAA is a determination going to substantive liability and in conformity with the interpretation of s 1771 adopted in George  McAndrew  FJ Bloemen and Dalco  is put in issue by an appeal which challenges the assessment on the ground that it is excessive  Later Mason CJ referred specifically to the susceptibility of a determination under s 177F to attack in an appeal to this Court against an objection decision His Honour stated at 1878  In such an appeal it is for the taxpayer to show that the assessment is excessive In that context the existence of an inadmissible purpose on the part of the Commissioner plays no part The central element of the legislative rgime is the making of an assessment by the Commissioner which ascertains the taxpayers liability to tax and the reference to the Tribunal or the appeal to the Federal Court in which the taxpayer is entitled to dispute his or her substantive liability to tax In such an appeal the taxpayer is at liberty to challenge the exercise of any relevant discretion by the Commissioner Thus on appeal the court will set aside the assessment if any relevant exercise of discretion by the Commissioner is affected by error of law if he has taken an extraneous factor into account or if he has failed to consider a material factor citing Avon Downs at 360 emphasis added152 I am concerned with an appeal under Pt IVC of the TAA that is to say a proceeding in which production of the Commissioners notice of assessment is not conclusive evidence as to the amount or particulars of the assessment yet is conclusive as to the due making of the assessment in other respects Cases such as FJ Bloemen and Richard Walter are distinguishable on their facts as not being in the nature of appeals

06_1252.xml,c13,discussed,George v Commissioner of Taxation [1952] HCA 21 ; (1952) 86 CLR 183,46 The role of ss 1771 and 190b of the ITAA arose in George v Commissioner of Taxation 1952 HCA 21  1952 86 CLR 183  George  A condition of the enlivening of the Commissioners power to make an assessment under s 167 was relevantly his not being satisfied with the return furnished by a person There were also alternative conditions namely default in making a return or the Commissioners having reason to believe that a person who had not furnished a return had derived assessable income Mr George however had lodged a return On appeal to the High Court in its original jurisdiction against the Commissioners objection decision the taxpayer sought an order for particulars of the sources of the additional income that the Commissioner had assessed to tax Thus like Avon Downs George was a state of mind case but the particulars sought did not relate to the Commissioners state of mind47 At first instance Kitto J dismissed the application for particulars His Honours exposition of the effect of s 190b is clear and deserves to be quoted at some length His Honour stated at 189190  If at the hearing the onus would be upon the commissioner to establish that the appellant did in fact derive more income in the relevant year than he had disclosed there would be much to be said for ordering him to give particulars for the purpose of defining the precise issues for trial and preventing surprise But s 190b places the burden of proving that the assessment is excessive upon the appellant and in order to carry that burden he must necessarily exclude by his proof all sources of income except those which he admits His case must be that he did not derive from any source taxable income to the amount of the assessment That will involve him of course in accounting for the increase in his assets and it may well be that the commissioner will direct his efforts mainly or even wholly to endeavouring to meet the evidence the appellant adduces on this point But the source of the increase in the assets is not the actual issue in the case even if it were proved for example that that source consisted of winning bets on the racecourse the issue would still be whether or not from any source the appellant derived as much taxable income as the assessment treats him as having derived   The object of the present application is really to have the commissioner say whether he is prepared to assign a source or sources for the moneys included in taxable income in the assessment over and above those disclosed as taxable income in the return and to admit that if they did not come from that source or from one or more of those sources those moneys were not liable to be included in the appellants taxable income The commissioner may if he chooses voluntarily narrow the possible range of evidence in that way but there could be no justification for ordering him to do so under the guise of ordering particulars If he attempts to prove derivation from a particular source and fails he is none the less entitled under the Act to point to another source or without troubling about source at all to stand upon his assessment and submit that the presumption in its favour has not been displaced Even if the commissioner at present has in mind to seek to prove that income not disclosed in the return was derived from a particular source he cannot be pinned to that source nor would it be proper to order him to reveal his present plan of campaign He is entitled to say I do not allege anything about source at all I may have ideas on the subject but if I have I shall develop or modify or abandon or replace them as occasion may require until the evidence on the hearing is complete and then I shall make my submissions to the Court  His Honour then said by reference to English authorities that a defendant may be ordered to provide particulars where it is clear that he intends to establish his denial of the plaintiffs averment of a negative by proving a positive His Honour said that if the Commissioner had admitted that he intended to set up a case that the additional income was derived from a particular source he should give particulars sufficient to enable the taxpayer to meet that case But the Commissioner had made no such admission express or implied48 In a joint judgment dismissing the taxpayers appeal the Full Court said at 204  The fact is that unless the taxpayer discharges the burden laid upon him by s 190b of proving that this ascertainment or judgment is excessive he cannot succeed and it can be no part of the duty of the commissioner to establish affirmatively what judgment he formed much less the grounds of it and even less still the truth of the facts affording the grounds Yet that is what is involved when the demand for particulars of the sources alleged of the appellants income is justified by reference to s 167 It is an error to treat the formation by the commissioner of a judgment as to the amount of the taxable income as if it were not the ascertainment of the taxable income which constitutes assessment or a necessary part of that process and as if it were but the fulfilment of a condition precedent to the power or authority to assess If however it were a condition precedent the question would at once arise whether the fulfilment of the condition was not part of the due making of the assessment of which s 1771 makes the production of a notice of assessment conclusive evidence But of this it is unnecessary to speak specifically49 At 206207 their Honours said that s 177 distinguished between the procedure or mechanism by which the taxable income and tax is ascertained or assessed on the one hand and on the other hand the substantive liability of the taxpayer The former their Honours said involved the due making of the assessment as to which production of the assessment was conclusive They concluded at 207  Obviously the due making of the assessment was intended to cover all procedural steps other than those apparently procedural steps if any going to substantive liability and so contributing to the excessiveness of the assessment the thing which is put in contest by an appeal  The distinction between two classes of procedural steps is a difficult one A taxpayer is to be at liberty by attacking procedural steps of one class to prove in an appeal that the amount of the assessment is excessive but may not attack other procedural steps which are left shielded by the due making of the assessment50 As noted earlier in his SFIC in each of the present cases the Commissioner has stated in accordance with a familiar formula that he relies on s 14ZZO of the TAA and requires the Taxpayer to discharge its burden of proving that the assessment is excessive see 39 above51 The Commissioner has identified the various objective conditions the determinations made and the amounts of the respective arms length considerations involved 17897644 in the case of WRCH and 986180 in the case of WRCA He has not however positively asserted or foreshadowed an intention to prove that he had regard to any particular matters in making the determination Why would he His having regard to any particular matters is not made a condition of liability to tax52 George is at least clear authority against the Taxpayers right to particulars on the second ground on which the Commissioner relies55 In a joint judgment Dixon CJ McTiernan and Webb JJ referred to the distinction recognised in George at 206 207 between the procedure or mechanism by which taxable income and tax are assessed on the one hand and the substantive liability to tax on the other They said that the conditions went to substantive liability and that it was open to the taxpayer to dispute their existence on an appeal against an assessment If the conditions were not satisfied the Commissioners power to amend would not be enlivened and the amended assessment would be shown to be excessive at 27156 Similarly Kitto J said at 274275 that the expression due making in s 1771 covered all procedural steps other than those if any which go to substantive liability and so contributing to the excessiveness of the assessment his Honour also cited George at 207 His Honour added at 275  It the expression due making is s 1771 therefore covers the step of forming the opinion that an avoidance of tax is due to fraud or evasion and the step of thinking that particular alterations or additions are necessary to correct an error in calculation or a mistake of fact or to prevent avoidance of tax The correctness of these steps may be challenged on a reference to a board of review for s 1771 seems clearly enough to be a provision relating only to evidence in the sense of material to be considered by judicial tribunals Doubtless it is for that reason that the words of exception in the subsection which refer to proceedings on appeal make no mention of proceedings on a reference  His Honour referred to a statement by Isaacs ACJ in Commissioner of Taxation v Clarke 1927 HCA 49  1927 40 CLR 246 at 276 that the legislation does not contemplate a curial diving into the many official and confidential channels of information to which the commissioner may have recourse to protect the Treasury83 Aickin J delivered the leading judgment Barwick CJ and Gibbs Mason and Jacobs JJ expressed agreement with his Honours reasons His Honour said that the particulars sought were necessary so that the case would proceed in an orderly and comprehensible manner at 227 His Honour thought that it was not in the interests of the proper administration of justice that on the hearing the appellant should have to speculate about and adduce evidence to negate every possible kind of agreement or arrangement and avoidance which the imagination of his advisers can conjure up ibid It did not matter that s 260 was selfexecuting and did not depend on the Commissioners forming an opinion or reaching a state of satisfaction With his Honours approach may be contrasted that of Kitto J in George see 47 above93 Both Hutley JA and Mahoney JA made certain observations relevant to the scope of an appeal then under Pt V of the ITAA against an objection decision Hutley JA said at 411 referring to Duggan and George  that an appeal under Pt V was of the most comprehensive kind so that for example it could be shown on such an appeal that a belief by the Commissioner as to the existence of certain facts was unsound115 The effect of ss 175 and 1771 of the ITAA was considered by the High Court in Dalco  The Commissioner had assessed under ss 166 and 167 as in George  A majority in a Full Court of this Court had held that the taxpayer had shown that each assessment was excessive in that it was not warranted by law  Dalco v Commissioner of Taxation 88 1988 ATC 4649 at 4666 Accordingly this Court had remitted each matter to the Commissioner for reassessment117 Brennan J and Toohey J ibid referred to George  in which the High Court stated that the burden lay on the taxpayer of establishing affirmatively that the amount of taxable income for which he has been assessed exceeds the actual taxable income which he has derived during the year of income  George at 201118 I see the cases under ss 166 and 167 as distinguishable from cases under Pt IVA and Div 13 in one respect In cases under Pt IVA and Div 13 the making of determinations by the Commissioner is a necessary element in the assessment All other things being equal if the taxpayer is permitted to establish and does establish that the determinations were not authorised by the ITAA the real world will be left in place the ITAA will work on it to establish the amount of the taxpayers liability and that amount will be less than the amount assessed Under ss 166 and 167 however in order to prove excessiveness the taxpayer must prove affirmatively the correct amount of taxable income and of tax If the taxpayer fails to do so the possibility will always remain that the Commissioners assessment is not excessive128 Mason CJ observed at 178 that the making of a determination under s 177F forms part of the process of assessment and goes to the ascertainment of the substantive liability of the taxpayer to tax  emphasis in original His Honour referred to the distinction recognised in George  McAndrew  FJ Bloemen and Dalco  between the procedural mechanism by which taxable income is ascertained on the one hand and the taxpayers substantive liability on the other the former alone involving the due making of the assessment at 182184 After referring to certain illustrations of the distinction the Chief Justice observed at 184   the making of a determination by the Commissioner under s 177F of the ITAA is a determination going to substantive liability and in conformity with the interpretation of s 1771 adopted in George  McAndrew  FJ Bloemen and Dalco  is put in issue by an appeal which challenges the assessment on the ground that it is excessive  Later Mason CJ referred specifically to the susceptibility of a determination under s 177F to attack in an appeal to this Court against an objection decision His Honour stated at 1878  In such an appeal it is for the taxpayer to show that the assessment is excessive In that context the existence of an inadmissible purpose on the part of the Commissioner plays no part The central element of the legislative rgime is the making of an assessment by the Commissioner which ascertains the taxpayers liability to tax and the reference to the Tribunal or the appeal to the Federal Court in which the taxpayer is entitled to dispute his or her substantive liability to tax In such an appeal the taxpayer is at liberty to challenge the exercise of any relevant discretion by the Commissioner Thus on appeal the court will set aside the assessment if any relevant exercise of discretion by the Commissioner is affected by error of law if he has taken an extraneous factor into account or if he has failed to consider a material factor citing Avon Downs at 360 emphasis added139 Hill J whose eminence in this field is beyond question delivered the leading judgment His Honour held that a taxpayer cannot challenge a determination under s 177F on the ground that the Commissioner had erred in the making of the determination for example by failing to take into account a relevant consideration His Honour was clear in his view that ss 175 and 1771 produced this result He referred to George at 207 see 49 above and Richard Walter at 184 Mason CJ see 128 above Of the latter passage Hill J stated at 237  In other words it is not open to a taxpayer to challenge an assessment under Pt IVA by showing some error in the making of that determination  His Honour found support in the fact that in Richard Walter their Honours held that the question in every case was whether there was a tax benefit obtained in connection with a Pt IVA scheme susceptible to cancellation by the Commissioner Hill J added at 238   The question whether the Commissioners discretion sic decision as to whether there was a scheme to which Part IVA applied miscarried is thus not an issue in an appeal Rather the issue will be relevant to the present appeal whether the determination having been made there was a scheme to which the provisions of Part IVA applied and if so whether there was a tax benefit obtained in connection with that scheme These will be matters of fact and the burden will lie on the taxpayer to show that objectively there was no scheme in connection with which the taxpayer obtained a tax benefit If the taxpayer satisfies that burden he or she will have shown the assessment was excessive That will not be shown by the taxpayer demonstrating that the person who made the determination in some way erred in making it so that the discretion conferred upon the Commissioner miscarried154 The position established by Peabody see 119 above Sleight see 136 145 above and Syngenta see 146 150 above seems to be that a distinction is to be drawn between cases in which the ITAA specifies a state of mind on which the assessment of the amount of taxable income and tax depends cf Avon Downs  George  Giris  Duggan  Brian Hatch  Kolotex  WA Capital  Dalco  and those in which it specifies not a state of mind but the making of a determination as the event on which the amount of taxable income and tax depends cf Jackson  Peabody  Richard Walter  Binetter Sleight  Syngenta  In the latter class of case the legislature is taken to indicate that the interaction between s 1771 of the ITAA and s 14ZZOb of the TAA produces the result that the Commissioners state of mind on the basis of which the determination was made is part of the due making of the assessment and cannot be put in issue by the taxpayer157 The second reason why the Commissioner should not be required to supply the particulars sought is that he has not asserted and does not propose to assert a positive case as to his state of mind or reasoning processes of which in accordance with the general principles governing the supply of particulars particularisation might be appropriate cf George  Kitto J discussed at 46 above In the light of ss 136AD and 1771 of the ITAA and 14ZZO of the TAA the Commissioner is entitled not to assert any particular state of mind or reasoning process and simply to rely on his assessment

Giris  Giris concerned the alternative bases of assessment of the income of trust estates provided for by ss 99 and 99A of the ITAA Section 99A did not apply only if the Commissioner was of the opinion that it would be unreasonable that it should apply in which case s 99 applied The Commissioner assessed under s 99A60 In the High Court Menzies J referred to a Full Court the question of the constitutional validity of relevantly s 99A All members of the Court held that s 99A was not constitutionally invalid as imposing an incontestable tax because the taxpayer had access to the court to challenge the Commissioners opinion61 Barwick CJ and Windeyer J indicated how this access might be availed of The Chief Justice said that the Commissioner was under a duty to form an opinion and that the taxpayer was entitled to be informed of it and upon the taxpayers request the Commissioner should inform the taxpayer of the facts he has taken into account in reaching his conclusion p 373 His Honour added at 374  Thus the Commissioner must hold the opinion The Court can decide whether or not he did hold it In my opinion the Court can require him to form it It can determine whether the opinion is held bona fide and although as I have said the discretion is wide and though being really legislative in nature what is relevant to its formation may range over an extremely wide spectrum of fact and consideration the Court can determine whether or not the opinion was formed arbitrarily or fancifully or upon facts or considerations which could not be regarded as relevant even to such a question as the unreasonableness of applying a taxing provision to a particular taxpayer in respect of the income of a particular year In my opinion it cannot properly be said that there is here an unchallengeable tax as that expression is used in reasons for decisions given in this Court  Windeyer J also observed at 384 that the Commissioner could be asked by a taxpayer to state the grounds of his opinion and if asked that he should do so62 Owen J approached the matter differently His Honour seems to have accepted that the taxpayer might not be in a position to prove that the Commissioner had taken into consideration irrelevant matters at 388389 His Honour said that all that mattered for constitutional validity purposes was that the taxpayer was not prevented from invoking the aid of the courts to determine whether his tax liability had been lawfully and correctly assessed It did not matter for that purpose that it might be difficult or impossible to exercise the right of appeal successfully because the facts necessary to success could not be established at 38863 Neither Kitto J at first instance nor the members of the Full Court referred to the relationship between ss 1771 and 190b of the ITAA64 Giris was another state of mind case Moreover examinability of the Commissioners opinion was in substance all that stood between a contestable tax and an incontestable one On the assumption that there was no challenge to the Commissioners assessment of the taxpayers taxable income the only question going to the excessiveness of his assessment of tax was his opinion that it was not unreasonable that the special rate of tax imposed pursuant to s 99A should apply78 Barwick CJ dissented His Honour said at 541 that the Commissioner should have recorded his relevant state of mind and the facts or his view of the facts on which it is based and that it should not be left to the Court to draw inferences as to whether he had considered a matter The Chief Justice added citing his own judgment in Giris  that the Commissioner must expose to the taxpayer particularly if so requested  both his state of mind at the relevant time and its basis at 541 emphasis added Like the majority and Windeyer J in Brian Hatch  his Honour saw the issue as being one of fact was the Commissioner in fact satisfied at the point of assessment or not His Honour disagreed with the majority however as to the Commissioners right to support his state of dissatisfaction at the time by a course of reasoning devised later154 The position established by Peabody see 119 above Sleight see 136 145 above and Syngenta see 146 150 above seems to be that a distinction is to be drawn between cases in which the ITAA specifies a state of mind on which the assessment of the amount of taxable income

06_1252.xml,c15,discussed,Jackson v Commissioner of Taxation (1989) 87 ALR 461,99 In Jackson v Commissioner of Taxation 1989 87 ALR 461  Jackson  the Commissioner made a determination pursuant to s 177F that the amounts of certain tax benefits should be included in the taxpayers assessable incomes for two years The taxpayer served on the Commissioner a notice to produce Gummow J set aside certain questions for separate decision100 The first question was whether on the hearing of an appeal against the disallowance of an objection against an assessment made consequent upon the making of a determination under s 177F1 it is necessary or relevant for the court to inquire into the matters taken into account by the Commissioner or his reasoning process when he formed the view that a tax benefit had been obtained or would have been obtained but for the operation of s 177F by a taxpayer in connection with a scheme to which Pt IVA applied His Honour answered this first question No101 This holding is instructive but not presently relevant The obtaining of a tax benefit was one condition precedent to the arising of the Commissioners power to make a determination under s 177F Whether that condition was satisfied was to be decided by the application of objective criteria The condition was thus akin to the present objective condition that the taxpayer supplied property under an international agreement or that the amount of the consideration received or receivable by the taxpayer was less than the arms length consideration102 While no doubt the Commissioner did think that that condition was satisfied his opinion that it was not made an element of the liability to tax and his reasons for being of that opinion were therefore irrelevant Defective reasoning on his part would not advance the taxpayers case if the condition was in fact satisfied103 The second separate question was related to the Commissioners determination pursuant to s 177F but not to the provision of particulars The question was whether in an appeal documents are discoverable by the Commissioner or liable to be the subject of a subpoena or notice to produce addressed to the Commissioner by reason only that the documents record or comprise in substance the submissions and internal memoranda prepared by the Commissioners officers for consideration by the officer who made the determination under s 177F and any decision or reasons for decision recorded by that officer or the facts matters or circumstances referred to in such submissions and memoranda106 Gummow Js answer to the second question does not resolve the present question of the Taxpayers entitlement to particulars It does however suggest that those particulars are not to be refused on the broad ground relied on by the Commissioner that s 1771 of the ITAA prevents the Taxpayers from attacking the Commissioners par d and subs 4 determinations on judicial review grounds While his Honour did not refer to s 1771 of the ITAA he did refer to s 190b and must have regarded a determination not authorised by the ITAA whether because it failed to satisfy statutorily prescribed conditions or because of judicial review grounds as lying outside s 1771 An appeal from his Honours judgment in so far as it answered a further separate question not presently relevant was dismissed Commissioner of Taxation v Jackson 1989 27 FCR 1135 Of some relevance to the present case is the following statement made by his Honour at 138139  A taxpayer may seek to challenge the making of such a determination on the basis that it is not authorised by the Act Indeed the objection to the present assessment includes such a ground In such a case the court has a discretion to order that there be produced to the court and subject to matters of privilege to the taxpayer the material which was before the decisionmaker who made the determination at the time the decision maker did so The courts power to make such an order was recognised by Gummow J when a Judge of this court and is discussed by his Honour in Jackson v Commissioner of Taxation Cth 1989 20 ATR 611 at 621 I am of the view in the present case that discovery of such documents should be given and the applicant be permitted inspection of them but that discovery and inspection be limited to the material that was before the decisionmaker  Hill Js reference to a determinations not being authorised by the Act is capable of being read as a reference to the nonsatisfaction of the statutorily prescribed conditions of the power to make a determination under s 177F1 or as a reference to judicial review grounds or as both The question is not resolved by the reference to the particular passage cited in Gummow Js judgment in Jackson that his Honour cited In view of his Honours judgment in the next case to be discussed however I would not understand him to have intended to include a reference to judicial review grounds142 With respect however their Honours appear to have found the result to be more clearly dictated by the authorities and in particular by Richard Walter  than I have found it to be It is not clear to me why the passage from the judgment of Mason CJ in Richard Walter at 184 set out in 128 above establishes that in an appeal it is not open to the taxpayer to challenge the making of a determination on judicial review grounds Moreover there is no reference to the passage from the judgment of Mason CJ at 1878 also set out at 128 above the primary Judge RD Nicholson J did refer to that passage but did not discuss it There is no reference either to Gummow Js answer to the second separate question in Jackson see 104 106 above or admittedly less relevantly to WA Capital see 107 114 above147 Gyles J considered that an appeal to the Court assumed the existence of a valid assessment and raised only the question whether the amount of it was excessive This in turn his Honour said involved only one issue whether or not the actual consideration was an arms length consideration as defined in s 136AA see 8 above His Honour remarked that this is an objective question and that the Commissioners opinion concerning it is not probative evidence in respect of it I respectfully agree cf Gummow Js treatment of the first separate question in Jackson 154 The position established by Peabody see 119 above Sleight see 136 145 above and Syngenta see 146 150 above seems to be that a distinction is to be drawn between cases in which the ITAA specifies a state of mind on which the assessment of the amount of taxable income and tax depends cf Avon Downs  George  Giris  Duggan  Brian Hatch  Kolotex  WA Capital  Dalco  and those in which it specifies not a state of mind but the making of a determination as the event on which the amount of taxable income and tax depends cf Jackson  Peabody  Richard Walter  Binetter Sleight  Syngenta  In the latter class of case the legislature is taken to indicate that the interaction

High Court in its original jurisdiction against an objection decision Subsection 1702 of the ITAA provided that where a taxpayer had not made to the Commissioner a full and true disclosure of all material facts necessary for his assessment and there had been an avoidance of tax the Commissioner might amend the assessment Where the Commissioner was of opinion that the avoidance was due to fraud or evasion he might do so at any time otherwise there was a six year time limit Thus the power to amend was conditioned upon the objective fact of the taxpayers not having made a full and true disclosure and on the subjective fact of the Commissioners being of the opinion that there had been an avoidance of tax At the parties request Dixon J stated a case which submitted certain questions for the opinion of a Full Court54 The Full Court held referring inter alia  to s 190b of the ITAA that upon production of a notice of assessment the Commissioner did not bear the onus of establishing satisfaction of the conditions but that the taxpayer bore the onus of establishing their nonfulfilment58 Consistently with the joint judgment in McAndrew  the Taxpayers seek to establish nonsatisfaction of the conditions that enliven of the powers to make the par d and subs 4 determinations Only Kitto J in McAndrew addressed the question of the Commissioners antecedent thought processes and his view as expressed above was that by reason of s 1771 they were not to be inquired into on an appeal to the court116 The High Court reversed this Courts decision Mason CJ Deane Gaudron and McHugh JJ agreed with Brennan J and Toohey J Brennan J said at 621 that a taxpayers burden of proving that an assessment is excessive is not necessarily discharged by showing an error by the Commissioner in forming a judgment as to the amount of the assessment His Honour distinguished McAndrew as a case in which it was denied that the Commissioner had the power to make an amended assessment for nonfulfilment of a condition precedent to the arising of that power His Honour said at 623 the amount of the assessment might not be excessive in fact though the reasons which led to the assessment were erroneous119 The distinction between state of mind cases and Commissioners determination cases was referred to by the High Court in Commissioner of Taxation v Peabody 1994 HCA 43  1994 181 CLR 359  Peabody  a Part IVA case In a joint judgment all seven members of the High Court stated at 382  Under s 177F1 the Commissioners discretion to cancel a tax benefit extends only to a tax benefit obtained in connexion with a scheme to which Pt IVA applies The existence of the discretion is not made to depend upon the Commissioners opinion or satisfaction that there is a tax benefit or that if there is a tax benefit it is obtained in connexion with a Pt IVA scheme Those are posited as objective facts citing McAndrew at 276277 Kitto J and referring to Avon Downs at 360 Dixon J  The erroneous identification by the Commissioner of a scheme as being one to which Pt IVA applies or a misconception on his part as to the connexion of a tax benefit with such a scheme will result in the wrongful exercise of the discretion conferred by s 177F1 only if in the event the tax benefit which the Commissioner purports to cancel is not a tax benefit within the meaning of Pt IVA That is unlikely to be the case if the error goes to the mere detail of a scheme relied upon by the Commissioner An error of a more fundamental kind however may have that result where for example it leads to the identification of the wrong taxpayer as the recipient of the tax benefit But the question in every case must be whether a tax benefit which the Commissioner has purported to cancel is in fact a tax benefit obtained in connexion with a Pt IV A scheme and so susceptible to cancellation at the discretion of the Commissioner emphasis added The erroneous identification and misconception to which their Honours referred might be compared to an erroneous identification by the Commissioner of the international agreement in question in the present case The error may or may not vitiate the Commissioners exercise of his discretion determining that subss 136AD1 or 2 as the case may be is to apply in relation to the Taxpayers in relation to the supply of property128 Mason CJ observed at 178 that the making of a determination under s 177F forms part of the process of assessment and goes to the ascertainment of the substantive liability of the taxpayer to tax  emphasis in original His Honour referred to the distinction recognised in George  McAndrew  FJ Bloemen and Dalco  between the procedural mechanism by which taxable income is ascertained on the one hand and the taxpayers substantive liability on the other the former alone involving the due making of the assessment at 182184 After referring to certain illustrations of the distinction the Chief Justice observed at 184   the making of a determination by the Commissioner under s 177F of the ITAA is a determination going to substantive liability and in conformity with the interpretation of s 1771 adopted in George  McAndrew  FJ Bloemen and Dalco  is put in issue by an appeal which challenges the assessment on the ground that it is excessive  Later Mason CJ referred specifically to the susceptibility of a determination under s 177F to attack in an appeal to this Court against an objection decision His Honour stated at 1878  In such an appeal it is for the taxpayer to show that the assessment is excessive In that context the existence of an inadmissible purpose on the part of the Commissioner plays no part The central element of the legislative rgime is the making of an assessment by the Commissioner which ascertains the taxpayers liability to tax and the reference to the Tribunal or the appeal to the Federal Court in which the taxpayer is entitled to dispute his or her substantive liability to tax In such an appeal the taxpayer is at liberty to challenge the exercise of any relevant discretion by the Commissioner Thus on appeal the court will set aside the assessment if any relevant exercise of discretion by the Commissioner is affected by error of law if he has taken an extraneous factor into account or if he has failed to consider a material factor citing Avon Downs at

referable to the power the Hickman principle127 It was held Mason CJ Dawson Toohey and McHugh JJ that s 1771 of the ITAA does not purport to deprive this Court of the jurisdiction conferred on it by s 39B of the Judiciary Act Deane and Gaudron JJ that s 39B overrides or amends s 1771 to the extent that s 1771 would make a notice of assessment conclusive evidence of the due making of an assessment in a proceeding under s 39B in which the applicants case is that an assessment is invalid on the ground that it was not made bona fide Brennan J that in proceedings other than reviews or appeals under

Commissioner is affected by error of law if he has taken an extraneous factor into account or if he has failed to consider a material factor citing Avon Downs at 360 emphasis added129 Unguided by later authority one might be excused for thinking that the effect of both passages from the judgment of Mason CJ is that it is open to a taxpayer on an appeal to this Court under Pt IVC of the TAA to challenge a determination under s 177F and I suggest it would follow under s 136AD on judicial review grounds The reason is that the taxable income and tax are as high as they are only because the discretion to make a determination was exercised and it is open to the taxpayer to show the excessiveness of the assessment by bringing down the determination As will be seen however in the case to be discussed next both the primary Judge and a Full Court of this Court understood Mason CJ differently137 The primary Judge RD Nicholson held  Sleight v Commissioner of Taxation 2003 53 ATR 667 at 697 that the making of a s 177F determination was part of the process of making the assessment  and not liable to challenge in this proceeding save in respect of matters going to substantive liability Richard Walter at CLR 178 203 His Honour held that it followed that any deficiency was validated by s 175 For this last proposition his Honour referred to Richard Walter at 182 1878 1935 1967 1989 209211 2223 and 2402 Finally his Honour noted that no argument had been made that the case fell within the conditions delineated in R v Hickman 143 Hill J also said at 237 that Richard Walter was consistent with what the High Court said in Peabody at 382 the passage set out at 119 above I respectfully agree that that passage in Peabody does favour the view that the only basis on which a determination by the Commissioner under s 177F and it would follow determinations by him under s 136AD could be challenged even in an appeal is the nonfulfilment of the statutorily specified conditions precedent to the enlivening of the discretion and I suggest the Hickman principle144 In both ss 177F and 136AD the ITAA specifies a number of conditions and provides that if they are met the Commissioner may make a determination the effect of which is that the taxpayers taxable income will be greater than it would otherwise have been With one exception all of the conditions are objective the exception is the condition in s 136AD1b and s 136AD2b and s 136AD3b not presently relevant that the Commissioner is satisfied that the parties to the international agreement were not dealing at arms length with each other Neither section makes the existence of any particular state of mind of the Commissioner in relation to the making of the determination a condition of the power to make it Sleight should be regarded as establishing that the legislature has revealed an intention that even in an appeal under Pt IVC of the TAA the Commissioners reasoning that led him to make the determination is shielded by s 1771 from attack on judicial review grounds as part of the due making of the assessment Of course the fact itself of the making of the determination goes to the substantive liability to tax if a determination was not even purportedly made or if a determination purportedly made was not authorised by the ITAA because the statutorily prescribed conditions of the enlivening of the power were not satisfied or I suggest failed to satisfy the Hickman principle the assessment will be shown to be excessive145 Consistently with Sleight  so understood not only should the Commissioner not be ordered to provide particulars relating to judicial review grounds but also he should not be required to give discovery and the taxpayer should not be entitled to lead evidence or to crossexamine any witnesses called by the Commissioner in each case in relation to such grounds 158 Although the Taxpayers are not at liberty to attempt to bring down the present determinations on judicial review grounds the determinations remain vulnerable to attack in the appeals on the basis of both nonsatisfaction of the statutory conditions of the Commissioners power to make them and the Hickman principle159 For the above reasons both motions will be dismissed with costs  I certify that the preceding one hundred and fiftynine 159 numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons

06_1254.xml,c11,cited,Sandell v Porter [1966] HCA 28 ; (1966) 115 CLR 666,It should also be noted that according to Alfred Wongs summary of the payments made to Austcorp on 23 November 2004 8 December 2004 and 9 December 2004 the amount paid was 337085760 which is precisely the amount that was owing by GPEL to Richland at 30 June 2004 immediately before the arrangement struck with Austcorp on 1 July 2004 That debt had been extended on 30 June 2004 to 30 June 2005 and the facility extended to 5M Consistent with the provisions of the Term Sheet for the extension of the facility the renewed facility did not mature until 30 June 2005 and further funds up to 5M would be available up to the maturity date If the facility was renewed on 30 June 2005 the facility would retain its character as a debt facility for an additional term If not extended GPEL had a discretion to effect a repayment of the principal sum and all accrued interest either in cash or by issuing fully paid shares in GPELAlfred Wong gave oral evidence in cross examination and at paragraph 18 of his affidavit filed 25 July 2006 to the position that the assignment by Richland to Austcorp of the debt payable by GPEL to Richland preserved the identical terms of the debt Accordingly Austcorp was not entitled to call upon GPEL for payment of the facility monies until the maturity date At the moment in time when GPEL made payments to Richland in respect of the assigned debt to Austcorp or alternatively made payments to Austcorp directly the monies prima facie were not due and payable by GPEL It seems that the very likely construction is that GPEL made payments to Richland at Alfred Wongs direction which were retained by Richland and subsequently paid to Austcorp in accordance with the arrangement made between Alfred Wong and Edgar Hung facilitating the continued use of the Austcorp monies by Richland until 30 June 2005 In any event the Board of GPEL had not approved the application of the monies Governance of GPEL was vested in the board of directors There is no evidence of any delegation of authority to the chairman either generally or within particular financial limitations to make payments on behalf of the company The Board of Directors was entitled to consider any demand for payment by either Richland or Austcorp assess the merits of such a claim take management advice in relation to the claim and reach a deliberative conclusion as to whether GPELs monies should be applied in making the payments Alfred Wong foreclosed that deliberative process in favour of his own interestsIt is difficult to conceive of any basis upon which the members or creditors of GPEL derived any advantage in these payments or the arrangement The advantage is said to be that GPEL was saved interest that would have been incurred upon the drawn down funds The interest payable under the facility was a margin of 7 above the 30 day bank bill rate 12 in all see 50 Upon repayment of the funds Richland established a facility on 8 December 2004 and an extension of that facility on 9 December 2004 at an interest rate margin which was also 7 above the 30 day bank bill rate Although discharge of the earlier facility may have reduced increments of interest on the principal draw down Richlands proposition was that it would reestablish a facility of the same size as the earlier facility and presumably if it was contemplated that significant draw downs would be quickly made interest would be incurred on precisely the same basis In any event whatever the commercial advantage of taking the particular course might have been it was a matter for the Board to determine the question with the benefit of management advice leading to a prudential business judgment rather than a fait accompli as a result of the conduct of the chairmanI take the same view in relation to the conduct concerning the release into the marketplace by reason of the conduct of Alfred Wong and Lielkajis of the Second Information Memorandum concerning the promissory notes to be issued by GPEC That conduct occurred in circumstances where the Board had placed a prohibition upon GPEL seeking to raise funds through promissory notes GPELs wholly owned subsidiary GPEC became an issuer of promissory notes pursuant to the Second Information Memorandum The deliberative processes of the Board in making an informed judgment as to whether GPEL through its subsidiary was in a position to raise money from the public with confidence that such money could be repaid and in circumstances where the Board could be confident that the Information Memorandum reflected a full accurate and truthful description of the circumstances of GPEL its business undertaking and its prospective activity were foreclosed  The minutes of meetings of the directors and the memorandum by Richard Nott reflect the strength of feeling in relation to issues central to a decision as to whether GPEL ought to raise money from the public through GPEC or otherwise by means of promissory notes 143 Public interest in the governance of corporations and particularly corporations listed on the Australian Stock Exchange demands engagement by the Board in material questions which affect or are likely to affect the affairs of the company and the interests of the members and creditors In this case the Board had expressed a strong view that further issues of promissory notes in the context of the companys liquidity its relationship with lenders and general capital adequacy considerations quite apart from going concern issues must not occur The question of whether that prohibition might continue to operate was not taken to the Board Explanations by Alfred Wong of a soft launch or a general high level introduction to the market of GPEL provides no compelling explanation for depriving the Board of the opportunity to engage in the affairs of GPEL and GPEC on such a material matter I am satisfied that a winding up order ought be made in respect of both companies pursuant to s 4611k of the Act I am also satisfied that in respect of the use of the JFCP funds by Alfred Wong and the foreclosure of the deliberative processes of the Board in assessing the matters I have described Alfred Wong acted in the affairs of the company in his own interests rather than in the interests of members as a whole and in a manner that was unjust or unfair to other members including JFCP because the funds were immediately deployed to reduce debt to a related entity rather than the deployment of the funds as construction equity to attract the Investec facility Accordingly an order ought to be made that GPEL be wound up pursuant to s 4611e  EVENTS POST 31 DECEMBER 2004   On 23 February 2005 the Audit Committee met The external auditors BDO reported that a key issue for GPEL would be the going concern and the recoverability of the 5MW plant at Staplyton Ian Fergusson  stressed that the issue of going concern for the company will still need to be monitored very closely by management and the Board  Peter Gan reported that he was continuing to work on the preparation of a capital management plan to be presented at the next Board meeting Peter Gan also reported that GPEL was budgeting for a 5M loss in the 30 June 2005 financial year On 1 April 2005 GPEL received a report from Expansion Capital Finance Pty Ltd Expansion Capital directed expressly to the question of a solvency concern The report was procured as part of a capital management study for GPEL against the background of four matters then under consideration by GPEL namely whether the pilot plant should be put on a program of care and maintenance due to the quite severe operational problems with the Staplyton 5MW plant  whether GPEL ought to sign an EPC agreement for a proposed plant without having secured debt and equity financing for the plant whether GPEL ought to utilise a promissory note funding program and whether GPEL ought to raise further equity funds to construct the Morwell plant then under consideration and later abandoned The author of the report observed that placing the 5MW plant on care and maintenance might involve an event of default under the Investec facility in terms of a material change in circumstance The author also gave detailed consideration to the financial aspects of the operation of the pilot plant As to the EPC contract the author recommended against signing an EPC contract in the absence of appropriate debt and equity funding As to the intended equity raising the author observed that   Further capital injections are subject to the markets confidence in GPEL In my opinion that confidence is rapidly being eroded for a number of reasons namely        it was stated in an ASX release on 18 November 2004 that the 63m capital raising at that time was to be used for the rollout of the projects in GPEs pipeline and in fact these funds were used to retire debt to Richland       recent company announcement referred to the IBAL Investec indicative offer of finance dated 30 December 2003 as existing debt facilities when in fact this is not the case      The author of the report observed that GPEL appeared to have the ability to meet its obligations over the next year as and when they fell due as GPEL had the Richland loan 2M facility drawn to 460000 at the end of February 2005 and Promissory Note facility 10M facility drawn to 450000 at the end of February 2005 to draw upon However GPELs ability to service those facilities relies completely on its ability to raise further equity capital Consequently if that ability is severely impaired GPEL may not be able to meet its obligations as and when they fall due emphasis added At the meeting of directors on 4 April 2005 the Board considered a recommendation to sell the pilot plant to Viridis as one mechanism for solving the continuing issues surrounding the pilot plant and further considered the financial position of GPEL going forward The minutes record these matters   Richard enquired about Jardine Flemings original payment and what was their understanding of the investment and also commented that there needed to be more certainty as to the loans from Richland going forward There was general concern over the Companys solvency situation   As for the loans from Richland the Company still has a 2 million line of credit The company needs 13 million to put up the plant either by raising equity for the new plant andor selling the 5MW plant at Staplyton and about 05 million for the monthly burn rate   Alfred also expressed his concern that as a shareholder he feels that the company should really stand on its own feet and not keep relying on him for funding As for the money received from Jardine Fleming it was acknowledged that it was used to retire debt owing to Richland however Alfred stressed that he has also been supportive of GPE and has always covered the burn rate for the last two years Alfred also pointed out that the interest rate charge by Richland to GPE was also more favourable than the market rate   Richard pointed out that whatever interest rate is charged by Richland we need to have certainty of the facility Richard requested that Peter give Alfred some notice before he draws on the money and also have a plan drawn up as to when he is planning to call on the balance Peter will review and report to the board on the loan facility documentation from Richland and ensure that both parties are evenhandedly dealt with emphasis added     At the meeting of directors on 20 April 2005 management gave a presentation on GPELs new business strategy with the main focus on stabilising the Companys capital position and ensuring that it was a going concern The minutes record   a Shortage of capital was putting GPEs business strategy at risk     There is strong indication that the EPC contractor Easteel will walk away from the power plant project as they are growing more concerned about GPEs ability to fund the project GPEs loss of credibility is also affecting the companys ability to procure reliable fuel contracts  Currently there is pressure from the creditors to clear the outstanding debts and there is also concern that two of its major creditors Investec and TechComm may want the debts repaid immediately Management was concerned that an administrator may be appointed if the Companys capital situation was not immediately stabilised   Management suggested that all projects should be put on hold Management made extensive recommendations about green waste fuel management and a possible move upstream into related fuel supply acquisition to provide certainty of supply for possible projects emphasis added      The minutes further record these matters   k Loan facility with Richland     The loan facility documentation between Richland and GPE is underway and a more formal drawdown arrangement is being organised Alfred expressed his concern for an equitable arrangement to be put in place   Richard stressed that under the Companys present liquidity situation  repayment of a loan prior to other creditors payments can constituted preferential treatment Also with the issue of the promissory notes distributed through a related company of Alfreds this could expose the Company and Alfred unnecessary especially since the Jardines money was for a specific purpose and not for the retirement of debt All of this could be interpreted as the CEOchairperson have privileged information when the debt facility was repaid using investment funds received from a third party   The Richland loan has to be restructured and formulised so that both Alfred and the Company are clear on the terms   Richard advised Alfred that he believes the loan should be repaid   Robert too stressed that the state the company is in it is imperative that the funds are replaced as soon as possible Robert also advised that it would not be wise to allow this issue to come back and bite us in the future Richard also concluded that the raising of promissory notes through a company related to Alfred in order to retire GPEs debts with Alfred could be construed as a conflict of interest emphasis added      Under the heading Managing Directors Report the minutes of the meeting of 20 April 2005 record these matters   Returning to the issue of the Richland loan Alfred claimed that the debt to Richland was due and payable at the same time as when the Jardine money also came in to which Richard responded that it is still crucial that Alfred replaces the money that was repaid rather than using the promissory notes to replace the original loan facility which still generates an additional income for Alfred It was agreed that Peter would work with Richard on the drafting of a new loan arrangement for GPE with Richland that meets everyones satisfaction by the end of this month Alfred requested that this review considered giving him security over the loans   Robert too has been very concerned about the companys solvency and any loan arrangements with Richland should be clearly documented The loan should also be a long term loan with the prospect of being converted to equity as was the original loan facility with GPE emphasis added     As to the position in relation to creditors Peter Gan explained that he really needed about 1 million to pay off all the immediate creditors with a 30 day ageing excluding TechComm whose outstanding amount is to be converted to equity emphasis added Alfred agreed to loan GPE through Richland the 1M required to repay the immediate creditors At the meeting of directors on 11 May 2005 the pressing question of cash flows available to GPEL was further discussed a capital management plan was tabled and further discussion occurred of access to an additional 1M from Richland to pay the debts of creditors then due and owing Peter Gan also noted the fall back 5M credit facility from Richland On 6 June 2005 Peter Gan prepared a strategic Update to Investec and sent it to Investec officers Richard Byrne Mark Schneider and Cosmas Kapsanis The Peter Gan update attached a report from TechComm which proposed a third option for limited running of the plant having regard to the first two suggested options of either closing down the pilot plant with a small number of staff on site to maintain the plant with periodic startups pending sale or alternatively mothballing the plant with minimum manning In relation to the pilot plant Peter Gan noted that the net operating pretax loss for the financial year to 30 June 2005 was 3M GPEL was planning to decommission the plant and place it in care and maintenance the long term solution involved either scrapping the plant modifying it and operating it with a 135MW plant or to relocate the plant At the Audit Committee meeting on 15 June 2005 the need for a debt raising policy to be approved by the Board was discussed among other matters previously mentioned In terms of the external audit of GPELs undertaking the auditors noted that the decommissioning of the pilot plant would obviously have an impact on the valuation of the asset On 15 June 2005 Investec wrote to GPEL noting that the proposal to place the pilot plant on care and maintenance would reduce the value of the security Investec expressed concern that cessation of generation might cause GPEL to be in breach of the terms of the Power Purchase Agreement Investec suggested a restructuring of payments satisfactory to Investec Consequent upon that letter a meeting took place on 22 June 2005 between Peter Gan and Jose De Nobrega and Cosmas Kapsanis on behalf of Investec The note by Cosmas Kapsanis arising out of that meeting records Peter Gans observation that GPEL intended to place the pilot plant on care and maintenance GPEL would continue paying principal and interest payments GPEL perceived the solution to the pilot plants difficulties was to develop a 135MW plant funding for the plant would be established through existing credit facilities in association with project finance and debt facilities from Investec that if Investec put the pilot plant loan into default that day and triggered a right to call for immediate payment GPEL would not have the financial capacity to repay and it was unlikely that any additional money would be provided by shareholders resulting in the company being put into bankruptcy  The Kapsanis note records that Peter clearly understood our strong preference for immediate repayment but is unable to fund that repayment from the resources available to him He undertook to seek funds from Alfred Wong for a partial repayment probably 50 of the residual he indicated to us that requiring repayment now of 100 of the residual is akin to demanding total repayment and would have the same consequence On 30 June 2005 a meeting took place between Alfred Wong and Peter Gan and Cosmas Kapsanis and Mark Schneider on behalf of Investec Peter Gan and Alfred Wong expressed their confidence in GPEL The Kapsanis note of the meeting records   We Investec restated our request for repayment or a reduction in the debt outstanding We propose that if they couldnt fully repay the bullet balloon payment at this time that they repay half of the bullet being approximately 1 million and continue advertising the loan to the same schedule resulting in a zero balloon at the expiry of the term GPE asked whether in exchange for a partial repayment of the bullet we would consider extending the term of the facility and we indicated that our credit was unlikely to accept such a proposal     At the meeting of directors on 6 July 2005 the Richland GPEL credit facility was discussed as was the assignment arrangement between Richland and Austcorp and the perceived affect upon GPELs liquidity arising out of the assignment Alfred Wongs perception that the Richland facility available to GPEL was to be an evergreen facility was noted On 4 August 2005 GPELs auditors BDO Ian Fergusson wrote to GPEL outlining events since 31 December 2004 which bring into question both the carrying value of the Companys assets and the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern  emphasis added Those events were the continuing operating losses incurred in respect of the 5MW pilot plant necessitating either closing the plant or placing the plant into a care and maintenance arrangement issues regarding the technical and commercial viability of the Staplyton No 2 project and the Morwell project the weakness identified in the direction and management of the company and the report to GPEL by Expansion Capital dated 1 April 2005 questioning whether GPEL was trading whilst insolvent  BDO expressed the view that GPEL appeared to have no means of generating cash to repay debts other than through the successful commercialisation of the pilot plant Staplyton No 2 and the project at Morwell Further funding secured from Investec was provisional on the technical feasibility of the projects BDO emphasised that It is imperative that the directors satisfy themselves that the company is a going concern emphasis added In order for the Board and the Audit Committee to be satisfied of that matter BDO recommended that the following reports should be prepared     Detailed cash flow projections covering in particular the period up to the generating plants coming on line and generating positive cash flows    Reports on the current status of both the Staplyton and Morwell projects the reports to include confirmation of technical viability confirmation that fuel supplies can be obtained detailed project plans showing when the project will come on line and cash flow projections for each plant during the construction phase and for estimated cash flows to be generated when the plant is operational      BDO observed that the proposal to place the pilot plant on care and maintenance may involve a material adverse change in the progress of that project BDO also observed that during the conduct of the audit of the accounts to 30 June 2005 BDO had become aware of the Expansion Capital report BDO noted the operational difficulties adequate fuel supplies with the Staplyton No 2 and Morwell projects and the fund raising program undertaken by GPEL through the issue of the promissory notes repayable on 31 March 2007 and 30 September 2007 before the Staplyton No 2 and Morwell plants would be operational BDO was concerned that GPEL would appear not to be in a position to repay the notes unless further funds are raised prior to Staplyton 2 and Morwell coming on line  BDO expressed its dissatisfaction with management and the Board for not advising us of the Expansion Capital Finance Report at the time it was considered by the company emphasis added Further BDO regarded the repayment of 34M to Richland as a significant event BDO noted that the loan so far as BDO understood the matter attracted a conversion entitlement to equity at the option of GPEL and that    given the fact that the company requires additional funding to complete its ongoing projects and to meet its day to day operating expenses the repayment of the loan was not envisaged in making our previous assessments as to the companys going concern position Repayment of the loan would not appear to be in the interests of the company given its funding requirements     BDO expressed concern that since the convertible loan was to Richland there may have been a risk that the interests of GPEL were not considered BDO drew the attention of the directors to the release to the Australian Stock Exchange on 18 November 2004 stating that the JFCP capital was raised to rollout projects in GPEs pipeline BDO also expressed reservations about the impaired carrying value of the pilot plant the carrying value of the Staplyton No 2 and Morwell projects and the need for directors to be satisfied that the carrying value of intellectual property rights was consistent with the recoverable amount for that asset Ian Fergusson concluded his letter by observing that In light of the above comments it is imperative that the directors have sufficient evidence that the company is solvent and is a going concern  emphasis added  BDO advised the directors that BDO had a responsibility to review GPELs assumptions as to solvency and going concern and form an opinion as to the appropriateness of the evidence to support the going concern assumption emphasis added  BDO requested the information to be supplied within two weeks On 11 August 2005 Alfred Wong met with Stephen Chipkin Mark Schneider and Cosmas Kapsanis to consider a proposal from Investec for a reduced exposure to the Staplyton Green Energy project The amount outstanding at that date was 3232M and the remaining term was 45 months Alfred Wong advised Investec that the pilot plant had not been placed on care and maintenance and continues to operate Investec sought GPELs response to its request for immediate payment of 57300000 being the subdebt tranche with continued payments of 46000 per month to amortize the senior debt at an accelerated rate Alfred Wong advised Investec that the    operating company did not have the funds to make this payment and the lack of funds is the result of a the lack of cash generation by the project and b an inability of GPE to further draw down on a loan facility that Alfreds family trust has made available to it This is because Alfreds facility was intended to be secured by a first ranking FF charge over the assets of GPE This security has not been put in place and Alfred has become aware that 2 million of the 5 million funding has been advanced on an unsecured basis The trust will not permit further substantive drawings without security     Alfred Wong offered to pay Investec the next three months principal interest payments constituting 14100000 in all On 17 August 2005 Ian Fergusson wrote to Alfred Wong as requested at the Audit Committee meeting the previous day setting out a list of  audit evidence that would help to assist us in reaching a conclusion to the audit process emphasis added As to the question of whether GPEL might be found to be a solvent going concern BDO requested detailed cash flow projections for the next three years covering the period of repayment of the promissory notes forecasts demonstrating cash outflows from operations cash outflows from investments GPELs required funding throughout the three year period a detailed business plan detailed group budgets discounted cash flow forecasts supporting evidence for all assumptions made in the forecasts the preparation of a sensitivity analysis in relation to the forecasts details of future funding arrangements including amounts required dates by which funds would be required sources of funds evidence that promissory notes could be repaid as each note fell due a letter of support and confirmation of balance debt from Investec in relation to the loan covenants a copy of a signed loan agreement for the 5M credit facility with Richland a letter of support from major shareholders and other matters BDO also sought information concerning the assessment of the carrying value of tangible fixed assets and intangible assets the nature of contingent commitments and uptodate management information and copies of Board minutes so as to enable BDO to assess post balance sheet events BDO also requested Financial Statements to be drafted particularly having regard to the filing deadline of 30 September 2005 and a Statement of Cash Flow Workings On 25 August 2005 Scott Tobutt a BDO representative advised Ian Fergusson that the higher level information such as the business plan and letters of support were being dealt with by Alfred Wong but that no completion date could be provided Further Tobutt observed that as he went through the list of required information with Edwin Yeung  Edwin would say yes we have that or it has been done or we can get that etc which we have heard before and we seemed to be going around in circles  emphasis added Tobutt confirmed that he had requested a file with cash flows for the group management judgments as to each cash flow scenario behind each cash flow forecast the supporting documentation for and evidence supporting all assumptions made by management together with additional evidence such as project reports and commitments for each of the projects The same approach was to be adopted in relation to the valuation of the assets including the intangible assets On 31 August 2005 Alfred Wong requested a letter of support for GPELs future green waste to energy projects from Investec On 9 September 2005 BDO Ian Fergusson again wrote to Alfred Wong observing that BDO was yet to receive any response from management consequent upon BDOs earlier correspondence Further Ian Fergusson observed that BDO was yet to receive the majority of the key items requested by the letter of 17 August 2005 Further BDO observed that the quality of the information that had been provided was unsatisfactory from an audit perspective  BDO expressed concern about the capacity to prepare and file a particular statement by 13 September 2005 BDO emphasised the number of significant issues that had to be addressed before completion of the audit could occur and in consequence finalisation of the annual report by 30 September 2005 In the letter dated 9 September 2005 Ian Fergusson said this   Our audit to date had raised the following significant issues which we believed have not been resolved satisfactorily and will result in BDO issuing a qualified audit opinion    Overall Going Concern of GPE    Carrying value of the Staplyton 5MW plant 76 million    Carrying value of the 135MW Staplyton Reactor plant 36 million    Carrying value of the Morwell costs 300k    Carrying value of the Intellectual Property Rights 45 million     Ian Fergusson further expressed this view in the letter of 9 September 2005   BDO cannot form an opinion on the going concern assertion and the carrying value of assets based solely on management representations  and unfortunately this is the only evidence which has been provided so far In order to be able to form an opinion as to the ability of GPE to continue as a going concern and to determine the recoverable amount of its assets we still require supporting evidence to show that any of GPEs assets will be commercialised and that GPE is able to continue as a going concern emphasis added    The letter observes that BDO was yet to receive a significant body of material The letter attaches a two page schedule of information sought such as data in relation to the carrying value of the assets forecasts the rationale for the determination of the recoverable amount of the intellectual property assets details of the amortization policy confirmation that the 135MW Staplyton project will go ahead and a significant body of other material    As to going concern 17 classes of information were sought by BDO As to the tangible fixed assets five classes of information were sought Five classes of information were sought in relation to the intangible assets and four classes of information in relation to contingencies and other commitments On 13 September 2005 Ian Fergusson on behalf of BDO wrote to Alfred Wong in these terms   I am writing to you to express our concerns in respect of the corporate governance of the company and its solvency and the impact these concerns have on our ability to remain as auditors of the company   Corporate Governance   We are aware of the factoring of the Richland Investment Australia Ltd loan that had been made to Green Pacific Energy Limited GPE and its subsequent repayment Notwithstanding comments made by you supported by legal advice you have obtained we have difficulty in concluding that this action was in the best interests of GPE   We are aware of the information memorandum which is seeking to raise promissory notes to be issued by GPE This action appears to be have been instigated by yourself without the mandate of the Board Further we are concerned whether the information being provided to potential lenders is adequate and whether it is misleading   The above actions would appear to reflect a lack of corporate governance that is required of listed entities   Going Concern   Again the matter of going concern and adequate business plans have been discussed at recent Audit Committee meetings We note that creditors appear to be paid in a selective way and only when further loan monies from entities you are associated with are received   Without an adequate business plan and funding for projects to provide GPE with power plants that can generate positive cash flows it is difficult for us to determine how GPE is able to remain a going concern   Implications for BDO   We would welcome receipt of firm evidence that the matters raised above have been either rectified or adequately addressed You should be aware that the matters are of a nature that require us to ad

06_1255.xml,c2,cited,N1202/01A v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural Affairs (2002) 68 ALD 21,Even if the period of time between his Honours judgment and the publication of written reasons is sufficient to explain the delay it is necessary to look at the merits of the proposed appeal to determine whether or not special reasons have been shown as to why there should be an extension of time  N120201A v Minister for Immigration  Multicultural Affairs 2002 68 ALD 21 at 13No draft notice of appeal has been prepared by Mr Conley and he does not seek an adjournment of this application in order to prepare that document In the absence of any draft notice of appeal I repeatedly asked Mr Conley to identify the proposed grounds of appeal In response Mr Conley consistently raised the same ground of appeal that he had filed substantial material before his Honour and that his Honour had not and could not have read all of the material in detail in the time available to himThe consequence of that alleged failure was said to be that his Honour did not consider the evidence in the filed material and its relationship to the ground there pressed The contention before his Honour was that the proceedings in this Court the bankruptcy proceedings were commenced and continued by the respondent the Bank as an abuse of processThe abuse of process is said to be the issuing of the bankruptcy proceedings by the Bank for the purpose of delaying indefinitely proceedings that Mr Conley had commenced against the Bank in the New South Wales Supreme Court the Supreme Court proceedings The Supreme Court proceedings concern the manner in which the Bank as mortgagee exercised a power of sale over Mr Conleys homeWhen asked to identify any evidence in the material tendered before his Honour directly probative of that assertion Mr Conley was unable to do so In fact he conceded that there was no direct evidence of that natureThe evidence that was tendered which included the statement of claim filed in the Supreme Court proceedings concerned the matters in dispute in those proceedings Mr Conleys submission is that his Honour should have inferred from the whole of that evidence that the bankruptcy proceedings in this Court were an abuse of process Some difficulty arises in substantiating that allegation of abuse of process because the Supreme Court proceedings were commenced on 26 June 2006 almost 5 months after the issue of the bankruptcy notice founding the proceedings in this Court It is hard to understand how the bankruptcy proceedings could have been commenced with a view to delaying indefinitely Supreme Court proceedings which had not yet been commenced However Mr Conley asserts that the Bank would have been aware from previous proceedings against it in the District Court of New South Wales the District Court proceedings that he intended to commence the Supreme Court proceedingsThis matter has a complex litigation history which need not be set out here The primary judge in his reasons set out that history in some detail referring to the District Court proceedings proceedings in the Local Court of New South Wales and the Supreme Court proceedings at 1 to 9 While his Honour did not refer in detail to the evidence before him he was satisfied that there  is a bona fide dispute that Mr Conley could raise in litigation to contest the exercise of the power of sale  at 5 His Honour was also satisfied that the statement of claim in the Supreme Court proceedings discloses a bona fide cause of action which was not colourable as an abuse of process at 11  His Honour noted that it was for the trustee in bankruptcy to decide whether to prosecute the Supreme Court proceedings if a sequestration order were made at 20The primary judge having been presented with an admission by Mr Conley that he was insolvent considered his task to be an inquiry as to whether Mr Conley had shown sufficient cause why a sequestration order ought not to be made pursuant to s 522b of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 Cth at 13 to 14 His Honour had regard to the public interest and concluded that he was not so satisfied at 20 to 21Although Mr Conley submits that the primary judge should have inferred from the whole of the evidence before him that the bankruptcy proceedings in this Court were an abuse of process no allegation of an abuse of process was clearly presented to his Honour Mr Conley refers me to the first ground in his notice of grounds of opposition to the creditors petition filed in this Court before his Honour Ground 1 in that notice states    The Applicant is manipulating the Court System to avoid or make it as difficult as possible for the Respondent to progress an ongoing claim against the Applicant in future court proceedings involving the fraudulent mortgagee sale by the Applicant of a property previously owned by the Respondent By reference to the transcript before the primary judge it is apparent that this ground was not pressed or dealt with in any detail before his Honour The only reference to a possible abuse of process that the parties identified in the transcript of the proceedings before his Honour is a statement made by Mr Conley in the context of a discussion of the effect of the bankruptcy on him Mr Conley submitted that the bankruptcy proceedings were intrusive that he was unable because of personal reasons to pursue his proceedings and that   i t is a very curious matter because it is only doing this to make it as difficult as possible for me to proceed in the Supreme Court That submission in the absence of any evidence was insufficient to raise for consideration an allegation as serious as an abuse of process It did not provide sufficient support to ground 1 in the notice of oppositionAn affidavit was tendered before his Honour which had been filed in the Federal Magistrates Court by Mr Conley on 6 March 2006 It annexed a number of medical reports on which Mr Conley relied That affidavit included a paragraph stating in general terms that the respondent was attempting to prevent Mr Conley from pursuing further claims in the Supreme Court His Honours attention was not drawn to the paragraph which in any event is cast in an inadmissible form and has the difficulties referred to at 11 above

06_126.xml,c0,referred_to,Yung v Adams (1997) 80 FCR 453,56 This point was made in Yung v Adams 1997 80 FCR 453 at 459 where Davies J observed that notwithstanding the width of the definition of inappropriate conduct it should be read subject to the legislative power under which the Act was passed  The Federal Parliament has no general power to regulate the activities of medical practitioners Therefore under Pt VAA the power to discipline in relation to inappropriate practice must be understood as a power to discipline in relation to conduct which is related to the payments which are made by the Commonwealth under the Act by way of medical benefits and the like Accordingly the reference to inappropriate practice in s 82 refers to conduct in relation to which Commonwealth benefits were paid or payable and in respect of which the medical practitioner failed in some way to meet the standards of the general body of the members of the profession in which the services were rendered The Commonwealths interest is to see that the services which are provided by a medical practitioner and for which a Commonwealth benefit is or may be claimed are services in respect of which the medical practitioner provides due care and skill that a claim if made is brought under the correct item and that overservicing does not occur57 The applicant contends that the comments of Gibbs J quoted at 37 above are not to be taken as stating a blanket proposition that any regulation of the manner in which practice is conducted is within power This is clearly correct However his Honours statement that  If the incident of practice which is regulated is not medical or dental but financial or administrative it is clearly outside the prohibition cannot be used as the applicant attempts to do as authority for the proposition that any attempt to regulate an incident of practice which is medical or dental will fall within the prohibition58 The applicant puts forward the General Practitioners case as authority for the blanket proposition that it is constitutionally impermissible to regulate any performance by medical practitioner of his medical duties and functions that such regulation was equated with compulsion and therefore with conscription This however is not what is held in the General Practitioners case What was crucial for Gibbs J in the General Practitioners case was that no medical service was compelled This is quite clear from his Honours comments at 55960  The provisions in question in these proceedings do compel medical practitioners to perform certain duties in the course of carrying out their medical practices but they do not go beyond regulating the manner in which some of the incidents of those practices are carried out and they do not compel any medical practitioner to perform any medical services Most of the duties imposed relate only to things done incidentally in the course of practice rather than to a medical service itself The only possible exception is s 16A 1 which requires that a request by a medical practitioner to an approved pathology practitioner to render a pathology service shall be made or confirmed in writing as prescribed A request of that kind may be regarded as a medical service However s 16A1 does not compel any medical practitioner to make such a request What it requires is that the request if made be made or confirmed by written instrument which satisfies reg 5 There is nothing in that regulation which affects in the slightest the performance by a medical practitioner of his medical duties and functions The statutory requirements may impose on him more administrative work In particular he is required to specify in his own handwriting the services to which the instrument relates and cannot simply mark a form on which is printed a list of possible services The reason why a condition of this kind is attached to the entitlement to medical benefits is no doubt that the use of the printed form might reasonably be regarded as likely to contribute to laxity and to facilitate fraud However that may be to require a practitioner to write out particulars of the service which he has decided to request another practitioner to perform is not to compel the practitioner making the request to perform a medical service Even more clearly the requirements of s 16A2 with regard to accounts and receipts and those of s 16A3 with regard to the retention and production of any written request or confirmation do not compel any medical practitioner to perform any medical service   For these reasons none of the provisions in question imposes any form of civil conscription contrary to s 51xxiiiA of the Constitution 59 I have quoted his Honours comments at length to make quite clear his Honours position His Honour found that the provisions in question did not breach the constitutional prohibition because put simply that which was compelled was not a medical service in itself although it may have been incidental to a medical service and where a medical service was regulated as by requiring a request to be made in writing the medical service itself was not compelled These comments do not support the proposition that any regulation of the way in which a medical service is provided is unconstitutional60 In my view the General Practitioners case is directly applicable to the present situation For the reasons I have given I do not find that the Medicare Scheme or the PSR Scheme impose any compulsion to provide medical services The decision to provide medical services is a voluntary decision The regulation of the manner in which such services are provided is properly incidental to the Commonwealths power under s 51xxiiiA to provide medical services and does not offend the constitutional prohibition against civil conscription In my view a proper application of the term inappropriate practice would sufficiently confine the concept to matters which are within the incidental power of the Commonwealth61 For the above reasons the applicants challenge to the constitutional validity of PSR Scheme must fail The appeal must be dismissed with costs I certify that the preceding sixtyone 61

06_126.xml,c1,cited,Attorney-General for Victoria v The Commonwealth [1935] HCA 31 ; (1935) 52 CLR 533,51 The High Court has cautioned that when considering the ambit of the incidental power whether arising by implication or expressly under s 51xxxix of the Constitution  it is important not to allow the incidental power to dominate the main power or as Rich J said not to put the cart before the horse AttorneyGeneral for Victoria v The Commonwealth 1935 HCA 31  1935 52 CLR 533 at 563 The point was well illustrated by Dixon J in the Pharmaceutical Benefits case The legislation under consideration there rested on the power of the Commonwealth to appropriate money under s 81 of the Constitution  Dixon J concluded that even if one accepted that s 81 authorised the expenditure of money on any purpose that the Parliament might think fit without restriction the scheme established under the legislation would still be invalid His Honour at 270 put the point thus   T he fact is that under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Act appropriation of money is the consequence of the plan the plan is not consequential upon or incidental to the appropriation of money52 Since the Pharmaceutical Benefits case s 51xxiiiA has of course authorised the provision of services that were not possible under the previous constitutional arrangements However as the General Practitioners case shows the incidental power is still relevant in an assessment of the constitutional standing of the PSR53 The applicant accepts that matters merely incidental to the core of clinical practice of medicine do not fall within the constitutional prohibition because they might constitute a necessary part of the Commonwealths administration of its benefits scheme In the applicants written submissions such incidental matters are said to include requirements about completing forms or with respect to accounts and receipts or financial and administrative matters The applicant does not accept that it is incidental to the Commonwealths provision of medical services either that it has the power to impose a standard which the services provided have to meet or the power to discipline medical practitioners whose services fail to meet that standard
06_126.xml,c2,cited,Attorney-General for Victoria v The Commonwealth [1945] HCA 30 ; (1945) 71 CLR 237,27 Section 51xxiiiA was inserted into the Constitution by amendment pursuant to s 128 of the Constitution  The proposed amendment had been approved by the necessary majorities of electors and was assented to on 19 December 1946 In explaining the background to this amendment in BMA at 285  Williams J referred to the different views as to the proper scope of s 81 of the Constitution Commonwealth power of appropriation expressed in AttorneyGeneral for Victoria v Commonwealth 1945 HCA 30  1945 71 CLR 237  Pharmaceutical Benefits Case and to the likelihood if the point arose for decision that a majority of the Court would hold that the Commonwealth could only expend its money on those forms of social services expressly authorised by the Constitution  namely invalid and old age pensions authorised by s 51xxiii The extension of Commonwealth power to the provision of the benefits enumerated in s 51xxiiiA had been put beyond doubt by the amendment and concerns that the extension of power might lead to the nationalisation of medical and dental professions were met by the prohibition of civil conscription see also D Mendelson Devaluation of a Constitutional Guarantee The History of Section 51xxiiiA of the Commonwealth Constitution  1999 23 MULR 308 31 Williams J was also not prepared to confine the operation of the constitutional prohibition to direct legal compulsion at 287 In his Honours view however the fact that s 7A carried a penalty for noncompliance implied legal compulsion and by compelling medical practitioners in the absence of a relevant request to the contrary to write prescriptions on forms supplied by the Commonwealth the section compelled the provision of a medical service to the Commonwealth Williams J summarised his view at 289  The scheme of the Act is to make the provision of a pharmaceutical benefit conditional upon a medical practitioner prescribing particular treatment so that in prescribing that treatment the medical practitioner is rendering a medical service to the Commonwealth He is in effect certifying to the Commonwealth that the patient requires a pharmaceutical benefit within the meaning of the Act  He is compelled to render that service in the course of rendering a contractual service to his patient But it is a service which forms no part of the implied contract for services created by a patient seeking the advice and treatment of a medical practitioner and the medical practitioner examining the patient with a view to giving him advice and treatment It is a compulsory service to the Commonwealth for the purposes of the Act which is superimposed upon the contract of the parties It is a compulsory service whether the obligation is absolute or absolute unless performance is excused by the person in respect of whom or at whose request the prescription is written37 Gibbs J disagreed with observations by some members of the majority in the BMA case Latham CJ at 249 Williams J at 290 and Webb J at 294 to the effect that a law which compels people to perform services in a particular manner is a law which imposes civil conscription At 557 Gibbs J explained his disagreement thus  That expression any form of civil conscription used in its natural meaning and applied as the context of par xxiiiA requires to medical and dental services refers to any sort of compulsion to engage in practice as a doctor or a dentist or to perform particular medical or dental services However in its natural meaning it does not refer to compulsion to do in a particular way some act in the course of carrying on practice or performing a service when there is no compulsion to carry on the practice or perform the service  it could not properly be said that it would be a form of civil conscription to require a person who had voluntarily engaged in civilian employment to perform the duties of that employment in accordance with the instructions given to him by his employers  There is nothing in the Constitution that would indicate that the expression any form of civil conscription where it appears s 51xxiiiA should be given an enlarged meaning which its words do not naturally bear The words any form of do not in my opinion extend the meaning of conscription and that word connotes compulsion to serve rather than regulation of the manner in which a service is performed Of course no express power is conferred on the Parliament to make laws to regulate the manner of performance of medical or dental services but it appears clearly necessary to the effective exercise of the power conferred by s 51xxiiiA that the Parliament should be able to make laws as to the way in which medical and dental services provided by the Commonwealth under the authority of that paragraph are performed and laws annexing conditions to the entitlement to any of the benefits provided under that authority even if those conditions may have the result that a medical or dental service must be rendered in a particular way if the benefit is to be obtained I find it impossible to discern in the words in parenthesis in par xxiiiA any intention to prevent the Parliament from making laws of that kind provided that no compulsion to serve is imposed
06_126.xml,c3,distinguished,Federal Council of the British Medical Association in Australia v Commonwealth [1949] HCA 44 ; (1949) 79 CLR 201,25 In making these submissions the applicant relies on the decision of the High Court in The General Practitioners Society in Australia v Commonwealth of Australia 1980 HCA 30  1980 145 CLR 532 General Practitioners case In the alternative the applicant submits that  a GPS is distinguishable and does not apply to the present case andor  b the construction of civil conscription in GPS is incorrect and should not be accepted by this Court Rather it is submitted the broader view of what constitutes civil conscription taken by Latham CJ Rich Williams and Webb JJ in Federal Council of the British Medical Association in Australia v Commonwealth 1949 HCA 44  1949 79 CLR 201 BMA case should be accepted28 In the BMA case  the High Court held that the prohibition against civil conscription in s 51xxiiiA applied only to medical and dental services and not to the other elements of the section At issue was the validity of s 7A of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Act 1947 Cth which required medical practitioners to use a prescribed form and adhere to a prescribed list of pharmaceuticals in writing a prescription if their patients were to be entitled to free pharmaceutical benefits It was an offence carrying a penalty of sterling50 for a medical practitioner to write a prescription other than in the statutory form unless asked to do so by the person for whom or at whose request the prescription was written The majority of the High Court Latham CJ Rich Williams and Webb JJ Dixon and McTiernan JJ dissenting held that the section imposed a form of civil conscription contrary to the prohibition in s 51xxiiiA29 Latham CJ emphasised at 243 that the power given to the Commonwealth under s 51xxiiiA is not a power to make laws with respect to pharmaceutical benefits and medical services but for the provision of such benefits and service The Chief Justice accepted that in providing such benefits and services the Commonwealth was entitled to rely upon the existing position in the community that is a system whereby private doctors prescribe medicine His Honour found that the incidental power derived from s 51xxxix of the Constitution entitled the Commonwealth when providing benefits out of public moneys to take precautions so as to prevent injury to the public and the useless or dishonest expenditure of public moneys30 The Chief Justice also said at 249 that the term civil conscription is wider than industrial conscription and is applicable to any compulsion of law requiring that men should engage in a particular occupation perform particular work or perform work in a particular way The Chief Justice emphasised that the words any form of in s 51xxiiiA evinced an intention on the part of the Parliament to ensure that any service to which the limitation applied should be completely voluntary Considering s 7A his Honour accepted that a doctor might escape the penalty by not writing a prescription but noted that if a doctor could not carry on practice without writing many prescriptions included in the prescribed list the doctor is not given any live option Given that the doctor had no power or right to procure or control a request that he not use the Commonwealth forms then he either had to use them or go out of practice The Chief Justice viewed this as a very real form of compulsion commenting at 253  There could in my opinion be no more effective means of compulsion than is to be found in a legal provision that unless a person acts in a particular way he shall not be allowed to earn his living in that way and possibly in the only way in which he is qualified to earn a living Webb J expressed a similar view at 292332 The aspects of the legislation that had led Webb J to conclude that the legislation involved a compulsory medical service were clearly identified by his Honour at 294  To reiterate if s 7A had not been enacted a patient requesting a doctor to write a prescription on the Commonwealth form which involves consulting and consideration of the Commonwealth Pharmaceutical Formulary or its addendum or both would request a service which only a doctor can render and which therefore is properly described as a medical service But when this service is made compulsory by a fine or loss of practice to avoid the fine then having regard not only to the extent of the professional work involved but to the almost unlimited number of persons entitled to insist on the service at any time it becomes I think not merely a compulsory service but a form of civil conscription within any meaning that can be given to that expression which if not quite clear was certainly intended to be comprehensive It is civil conscription of doctors as doctors His Honours comments on these aspects of the legislation are particularly instructive in the present proceeding33 The only other case in which the High Court has considered the meaning of civil conscription in any detail is the General Practitioners case  Certain provisions of the HIA ss 16A 16B and 16C and regulations made under the Act imposed conditions to be met before Commonwealth medical benefits were payable in respect of pathology services other than prescribed pathology services and also imposed obligations on some at least of the persons providing those services It was necessary for those services to be provided by or on behalf of an approved pathology practitioner The conditions and obligations were designed to prevent the supply of unnecessary or excessive pathology services34 The legislative provisions operated in conjunction with an undertaking to be provided by approved pathology practitioners and a code of conduct They had no application to a medical practitioner who was prepared to render pathology services for which no medical benefit would be payable and there was no legal compulsion on any medical practitioner to become an approved pathology practitioner The arguments put to the Court that the legislation imposed a form of civil conscription were summarised by Gibbs J at 549  First it was said that the laws positively require a practitioner to perform services of a medical kind Secondly it was said the laws by prohibiting practitioners from carrying on practice in what was formerly the normal way compel them to carry on practice in a different way  it was argued for the plaintiffs that few practitioners would be able to attract patients or to make a living from their profession if medical benefits were not payable in respect of their services and that therefore if ss 16A 16B and 16C are valid a practitioner who intends to render pathology services whether as a specialist or as a general practitioner is compelled by practical considerations to apply to become an approved pathology practitioner37 Gibbs J disagreed with observations by some members of the majority in the BMA case Latham CJ at 249 Williams J at 290 and Webb J at 294 to the effect that a law which compels people to perform services in a particular manner is a law which imposes civil conscription At 557 Gibbs J explained his disagreement thus  That expression any form of civil conscription used in its natural meaning and applied as the context of par xxiiiA requires to medical and dental services refers to any sort of compulsion to engage in practice as a doctor or a dentist or to perform particular medical or dental services However in its natural meaning it does not refer to compulsion to do in a particular way some act in the course of carrying on practice or performing a service when there is no compulsion to carry on the practice or perform the service  it could not properly be said that it would be a form of civil conscription to require a person who had voluntarily engaged in civilian employment to perform the duties of that employment in accordance with the instructions given to him by his employers  There is nothing in the Constitution that would indicate that the expression any form of civil conscription where it appears s 51xxiiiA should be given an enlarged meaning which its words do not naturally bear The words any form of do not in my opinion extend the meaning of conscription and that word connotes compulsion to serve rather than regulation of the manner in which a service is performed Of course no express power is conferred on the Parliament to make laws to regulate the manner of performance of medical or dental services but it appears clearly necessary to the effective exercise of the power conferred by s 51xxiiiA that the Parliament should be able to make laws as to the way in which medical and dental services provided by the Commonwealth under the authority of that paragraph are performed and laws annexing conditions to the entitlement to any of the benefits provided under that authority even if those conditions may have the result that a medical or dental service must be rendered in a particular way if the benefit is to be obtained I find it impossible to discern in the words in parenthesis in par xxiiiA any intention to prevent the Parliament from making laws of that kind provided that no compulsion to serve is imposed

in the Full Court of the Federal Court mainly concerned with practice and procedure However the case is instructive in relation to the ambit of s 10 of the Fair Trading Act  In that case the appellant had purchased a business from the first respondent The primary judge found that the third respondent who was a director of the first respondent made misleading precontract representations and held as a result that the first respondent had thereby engaged in misleading conduct in trade or commerce contrary to s 52 of the Trade Practices Act  The misleading representation related to profitability and value of the business The primary judge considered the third respondents liability but dismissed the action against him on the ground that whilst it was pleaded the third respondent had acted within the scope of his actual or apparent authority as a director or agent of the first respondent the pleading did not allege that the third respondent engaged in conduct in trade or commerce on his own account He also found that there was no plea that the third respondent was knowingly concerned in the contravention as defined in s 75B of the Trade Practices Act or s 68 of the Fair Trading Act  He concluded at 77 that therefore no derivative liability under the Act or the Fair Trading Act  was made out against the third respondent in respect of conduct by Idyllic held to contravene s 52 of the Act or s 10 of the Fair Trading Act  The appeal was against the primary judges failure to grant the appellants relief against the third respondent291 The primary judge said at 107 that the researches of Counsel have not revealed a single authority where an employee has been held personally liable for statements made in the course of his or her employment by an employer who or which was concededly engaged in trade or commerce He then went on to say   109 The consideration just indicated together with my own analysis in the light of the authorities of the common basis on which liability for deceptive or misleading conduct in trade or commerce is erected by both the TPA and the Fair Trading Act has led me to conclude that it does not extend to the conduct of Student or Houghton in the present case That is not to say that a director or sole shareholder of a company may not attract liability for statements made in the course of the companys business if their making can be characterised as tending to promote the directors or shareholders own trading or commercial interests See eg Arktos v Idyllic Nominees Pty Ltd 2004 FCAFC 119  2004 ATPR 42005 However no independent trading or commercial interest can be imputed to Student or Houghton in the present case The application against those respondents must therefore be dismissed292 That matter went on appeal The Full Court of the Federal Court in Arms v Houghton 2006 FCAFC 46 discussed the decisions in Arktos Pty Ltd v Idyllic Nominees Pty Ltd Citibank Ltd v Liu  and Wong v Citibank and concluded at 38 that there was authority both in the Full Court of this Court and in the Court of Appeal in New South Wales that an employee can be found to have engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct for actions taken within the scope of his actual authority that is not independently of such authority295 It will be convenient to address the claim under s 10 of the Fair Trading Act first The third respondent was a director of the first respondent It was submitted that in those circumstances he also contravened s 10 of the Fair Trading Act and he is liable to the applicant Arktos Pty Ltd v Idyllic Nominees Pty Ltd 296 In my opinion that submission cannot be accepted The critical fact in Arktos Pty Ltd v Idyllic Nominees Pty Ltd which made that director liable under the Fair Trading Act was that the director had acted on behalf of the corporation and made misleading precontractual representations within the scope of his authority as a director to the purchaser In those circumstances the Full Court concluded that he was liable for the reasons it gave at 13 cited above at 284297 It is not enough for an applicant to merely establish that a corporation has contravened s 52 of the Trade Practices Act and thereby claim that any director of that corporation is liable under s 10 of the Fair Trading Act  There must be a contravention by the director himself or herself That was made clear by Nicholson J in Caple v All Fasteners WA A Firm 2005 FCA 1558 In that case it was alleged that a corporation had contravened s 52 of the Trade Practices Act  It was pleaded that the appellant who was a director of the corporation but who had not been party to any of the representations which had been made was accessorily liable under s 75B of the Trade Practices Act and in the alternative primary liable under s 10 of the Fair Trading Act  The Federal Magistrate found the appellant was accessorily liable under s 75B of the Trade Practices Act  even though the representations were not made by the appellant He did not find her liable under s 10 of the Fair Trading Act  On appeal the respondent filed a notice of contention contending that in addition or in the alternative to the grounds for liability of the appellant contained in the reasons of his Honour the appellant is liable to the respondent in relation to her breach sic of s 10 of the Fair Trading Act 1985 WA as pleaded in the respondents reamended statement of claim at 77 The respondent relied on this Courts decision in Arktos Pty Ltd v Idyllic Nominees Pty Ltd to support the submission

Standard Oil Australia Ltd 1961 HCA 75  1961 109 CLR 407 at 414 415 concerning the different ways of assessing the criteria of substantially identical with on the one hand and deceptively similar to on the other His Honour said   In considering whether marks are substantially identical they should I think be compared side by side their similarities and differences noted and the importance of these assessed having regard to the essential features of the registered mark and the total impression of resemblance or dissimilarity that emerges from the comparison    On the question of deceptive similarity a different comparison must be made from that which is necessary when substantial identity is in question The marks are not now to be looked at side by side The issue is not abstract similarity but deceptive similarity Therefore the comparison is the familiar one of trade mark law It is between on the one hand the impression based on recollection of the plaintiffs mark that persons of ordinary intelligence and memory would have and on the other hand the impressions that such persons would get from the defendants television exhibitionsThe applicant submitted that   i The essential features of the registered mark are the star logo and the word STARR The essential features of the respondents mark are the star logo and the word Star ii The star logo in both marks is eye catching The star logo appears at the front of both marks It is the first thing seen when looking at the marks iii The star logo in both marks abuts the word part of the mark iv The differences in the star logos are minor The differences in the word part of the marks are also minor the registered mark has an additional R and the word is capitalised The word Partners is in lower case in the registered mark and is not an essential feature Similarly the word REALTY is not an essential feature of the respondents mark v Comparing the two marks side by side demonstrates that the essential features are substantially identical to each other and the differences do not detract from the total resemblance of the two marksThe applicant referred to s 10 of the Act which provides   For the purposes of this Act a trade mark is taken to be deceptively similar to another trade mark if it so nearly resembles that other trade mark that it is likely to deceive or cause confusionI was referred to what Windeyer J said in Shell concerning deceptive similarity quoted at 25 supra and to what was said by Dixon and McTiernan JJ in Australian Woollen Mills at 658   In deciding this question the marks ought not of course to be compared side by side An attempt should be made to estimate the effect or impression produced on the mind of potential customers by the mark or device for which the protection of an injunction is sought The impression or recollection which is carried away and retained is necessarily the basis of any mistaken belief that the challenged mark or device is the same The effect of spoken description must be considered If a mark is in fact or from its nature likely to be the source of some name or verbal description by which buyers will express their desire to have the goods then similarities both of sound and of meaning may play an important part The usual manner in which ordinary people behave must be the test of what confusion or deception may be expected Potential buyers of goods are not to be credited with any high perception or habitual caution On the other hand exceptional carelessness or stupidity may be disregarded The cause of business and the way in which a particular class of goods are sold gives it may be said the setting and the habits and observations of men considered in the mass affords the standard Evidence of actual cases of deception if forthcoming is of great weightAs noted in the extract from the judgment of Windeyer J in Shell quoted in 25 supra following the side by side comparison of the marks the noting of their similarities and differences and the importance of these assessed against the essential features of the registered mark it is the total impression of resemblance or dissimilarity that emerges from the comparison that determines whether the criteria of substantially identical is satisfiedApart from the partial star logo and even that is different in each mark the positioning of that logo with respect to the STARRStar word and the aural similarity of the STARRStar words the two marks have a number of differences I am of the view that the word Partners is an essential feature of the registered mark because it articulates the very structure of the applicants business a franchise operation involving various unrelated parties the partners carrying on discrete businesses under a common banner If that be right then the essential features of the two marks are quite different both visually and aurally and even if it is not right that difference between the two marks particularly coupled with the difference between STARR and Star are sufficiently significant themselves to militate against any conclusion that they are substantially identicalIn my view there is no substantial similarity let alone identity visually or aurally between the two marksThere seemed to be common ground as to the governing principles to be applied in a case where the question is whether a mark so nearly resembles a registered mark that it is likely to deceive or cause confusion It is a different comparison than that for substantial identity in the case of deceptive similarity it is one of impression based on recollection Shell at 415 which will be an imperfect recollection measured against a standard of side by side comparison As Windeyer J said in Re Bali Brassiere Co Incs Registered Trade Mark and Berlei Ltds Application 1968 HCA 72  1968 118 CLR 128 at 139   The governing principles are not in dispute and little is to be gained by the quotation of enunciations and elaborations

inherent jurisdiction of the Court to stay an action as vexatious is to be exercised only when the action is clearly without foundation and when to allow it to proceed would impose a hardship upon the

decided in the manner appointed must be observed A litigant is entitled to submit for determination according to the due course of procedure a claim which he believes he can establish although its foundation may in fact be slender It is only when to permit it to proceed would amount to an abuse of jurisdiction or would clearly inflict unnecessary injustice upon the opposite party that a suit should be stopped  see also Batistatos at 71 Jago at 31In concluding that there was no error of principle in the decision of the Court of Appeal the majority of the High Court said    in the

claims before the Court and have their claims heard as I have already noted this entitlement is subject to principles in respect of abuse of court process In reviewing the material before me however I keep in mind the warning of Dixon J in Cox v Journeaux and approach the matter with cautionKey questions of evidence before the Court for the purposes of this analysis may be summarised as follows 1 What is the likelihood of Mr Allan Hockey giving evidence 2 To paraphrase Bryson JA in Batistatos  is there useful evidence available upon which to conduct a trial or is the position that a trial of the proceedings could not rise above a debate about the effect of scraps of information with the result that no more than a formal enactment of the process of hearing and determining the plaintiffs claim could take place This second question should be particularly considered in light of evidence to which the applicants refer including A Records before the Court as contained in the affidavit of Mr David Sutton sworn 22 November 2005 and the further evidence given by Mr Sutton arising from crossexamination on 17 July 2006 B The affidavit of Mr Patrick Killoran sworn 12 May 2006 C Affidavits of Sir Llewellyn Edwards Hugh Lionel Fawsett and Sir Leo Arthur Hielscher d Queensland Government Cabinet documents from the relevant period E Affidavits of Bernadette Irene Albert Evelyn May Barker Shane Arthur OConnor Eric Michael Porter Maxwell Athol Smith and Paul ToolisIt is clear that obtaining evidence from Mr Hockey would be very important to the conduct of this case from the perspective of both the applicants and the respondents Mr Hockey was appointed Acting Superintendent of the Doomadgee Aboriginal Mission Reserve from 1 November 1958 I understand he remained in that management position until some time in 1983 and that he eventually left Doomadgee on 6 April 1983 His management role means that he would be able to give key evidence as to the role of the respondent in the conduct of the Doomadgee Mission over that period and to explain relevant documents and records from that period The importance of that evidence is enhanced by the fact that a number of key witnesses involved in the management of Doomadgee mission and liaison between the Doomadgee Mission and the respondent during the relevant period have died for example Mrs Hockey and Mr Bedford or are elderly frail and unable to give evidence for example Mr KilloranIt is clear however that Mr Hockey himself is now elderly and in frail healthAt the hearing on 14 July 2006 the ability of Mr Allan Hockey to give evidence at a hearing of the substantive matter was in dispute Counsel for the applicants indicated that he had spoken with a third party who had been in contact with acquaintances of Mr Hockey and was able to provide evidence that Mr Hockey was capable of giving evidence relevant to the issues in dispute I indicated that if this were the case the best evidence would be that from Mr Hockey himself I adjourned the hearing to allow the parties the opportunity to contact Mr Hockey and ascertain his ability to give evidence whether at the hearing itself by a preservation of evidence hearing by affidavit or otherwise

06_1289.xml,c5,referred_to,Smoker v Pharmacy Restructuring Authority (1994) 53 FCR 287,The background to these rules was explained by Hill J in Smoker v Pharmacy Restructuring Authority 1994 53 FCR 287 His Honour referred to an agreement made in 1990 between the Government and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia which was intended to reduce the number of pharmacies approved to supply pharmaceutical benefits His Honour continued at 294    the Government ultimately accepted recommendations made to it that pharmacy numbers should be reduced by encouraging pharmacists to either amalgamate or close to reduce the number of inefficient pharmacies and to strengthen the more viable pharmacies that remained Provision was to be made for closure payments and where an amalgamation or closure payment was made no new approval in respect of the premises was to be granted unless certain approval criteria were metThe subsequent development of this policy through two subsequent agreements and the change in emphasis from a preoccupation with concentration of pharmacies in a particular locality  to a desire to introduce more competition between pharmacies was referred to in the AAT decision under review The Third Community Pharmacy Agreement made in 2000 refers in clause 21d to a purpose in amending the rules governing pharmacy relocations as being to enhance competition consistent with the maintenance of a viable and well distributed community pharmacy networkI do not accept that the applicants interpretation interpolates into rule 6 an unarticulated criterion for determining which premises are the nearest In my view the reasons for interpreting nearest other premises as set out in 810 are coherent and acceptable subject to there being indications in the statute or otherwise that a different meaning was intended In addition I do not accept that the applicants interpretation defeats the purpose of having the two subrules with their different modes of measurement On the applicants interpretation once the nearest premises have been identified if the straight line measurement is at least 15 kilometres then the application must be approved If however that measurement is less than 15 kilometres then the distance from the proposed premises by lawful access measurement must be determined If that distance is 2 kilometres or more then a positive recommendation must be made under rule 6bii For instance using a common example assume pharmacy A is only 500 metres by straight line measurement from the proposed premises but is directly across a river so that the shortest means of lawful access is across a bridge some 3 kilometres downstream In that example the criterion in subrule 6bii would be met and a positive recommendation made even though subrule 6bi has not been met
06_129.xml,c0,cited,Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (1984) 58 ALR 305,13 The other basis upon which the learned Magistrate rejected the application was that there would be prejudice to public administration His Honour relied on well known remarks of Wilcox J in Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Minister for Home Affairs and Environment 1984 58 ALR 305 at 310 and following Wilcox J speaking of extensions of time generally and comparing the situation of public administration with that where merely private rights are involved said at 312  By contrast in cases involving public administration especially daytoday matters such as personnel management the public interest may well dictate refusal of an extension even after only a short delay    An applicant concerned to challenge a decision which has implications for other people or for daytoday public administration may properly be regarded as being under a heavier duty to act expeditiously than is an applicant who is aware that his case has no such implications14 The case for the respondent was that the APSC is only a relatively small agency and the reinstatement of Mr Twining would impact on its administration Evidence accepted by his Honour showed that the APSCs current financial year budget provided for a reduction in staff numbers which would continue for at least another three financial years that at the time the hearing before his Honour there was only one vacancy at the APS 34 level the level at which the appellant had been engaged and other matters His Honour accepted the submission that  There was no regular staff turnover such as expected in larger organisations Although reinstatement of Mr Twining would not be an impossibility it would be difficult and a burden An adjustment would need to be made to the respondents budget and programs offered by the respondent I gather to persons in the Australian Public Service Commission could be affected15 Speaking for myself I would not have attached the same weight to those matters as did his Honour However I am unable to say that for him to have taken that view lay outside the scope of the sound legal exercise of his discretion16 In the course of examination of the matter today other aspects of prejudice to the respondent emerged As I observed in the course of argument to some extent these are coextensive with questions that might arise in the Courts discretion as to whether a remedy might be granted if otherwise purely legal grounds of challenge to the termination decision were made out and the matters could be more fully debated in that context However given the way the matter has proceeded including that for the benefit of the appellant I have been prepared to review his Honours findings about the adequacy of the explanation without seeing the transcript and have perhaps gone further than one ordinarily would in departing from the findings of a court at first instance which has had the benefit of hearing and seeing highly relevant evidence given I think that the fact that the matters might later be considered if time were enlarged does not prevent them being considered on the question of whether time should be enlarged17 One of the factors that motivated Mr Jones the respondents delegate to dismiss the appellant was that he had displayed behaviour to other employees which had very much upset them and made working relationships difficult The material in the appellants own affidavits shows that at a time in early 2005 when albeit in ignorance he believed that he had no firm legal basis for obtaining a remedy in the courts he had quite gratuitously and offensively abused two officers of the respondent including the delegate who were senior to him and quite inappropriately broadcast to other people his offensive and rather unrestrained criticisms of them The appellant says he was upset out of his mind with worry about his position at the time18 Be that as it may it is quite clear that it would be irresponsible to put him back in the Programs Group in which he was employed That means that about 35 to 40 of the 130 positions in the respondents organisation would not be available to him The other officer whom he calumniated was the head of the Corporate Group which comprises another 35 or 40 people Much less offensive but quite inappropriate remarks were also directed to the head of the respondent Commission19 If time were extended and if the appellant were to succeed it would be in that environment that his reinstatement on probation for a period of about a month would occur At the end of that month if not before a decision would have to be made about whether overall his conduct and behaviour had been such that he should be taken on permanently To the extent that there would be difficulty about fitting him in it would by reason of his own conduct be very greatly magnified Notwithstanding the public interest in decisions affecting the termination of employment of persons in the public sector being regularly and lawfully made it seems to me that in the circumstances there would be likely such a disruption of public administration that the public interest dictates refusal of an extension of time20 For these reasons I consider that the decision of the learned federal Magistrate was correct even though I would reach it by a slightly different route21 Leave to appeal will be granted The appeal is dismissed with costs  I certify that the preceding twentyone 21 numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the

costs of this motion and of the application for summary judgment the proposed order 3As to what version of Order 3 as to costs should be made the Commissioner pointed out that IEF had made no submissions at the hearing in relation to the Commissioners claim that the applicant pay the respondents ie Commissioners costs of this motion and of the application nor led evidence concerning the need to apportion costs incurred by the respondent between issues of additional and primary tax The Commissioner referred to 130 of my reasons for judgment where I held that the t he Commissioner must have the costs of the proceedings to date inclusive of the costs related to the present summary application  and submitted that the text of the orders now sought should reflect that finding precisely

SEPTEMBER 2006 PLACE SYDNEY  REASONS FOR ORDERS   On 21 March 2006 I directed the parties to the four subject proceedings  IEL Finance Limited and Others v Commissioner of Taxation 2006 62 ATR 165 to provide draft declarations andor orders giving effect to the reasons for judgment delivered on that prior occasion The first of those four proceedings being numbered NSD 539 of 2004 and involving IEL Finance Limited as applicant was treated by the parties as the precedent vehicle for the most part for implementation of orders to be made in the remaining three proceedings The abbreviations adopted in these reasons reflect those used in the preceding principal reasons for judgment of 21 March 2006 There appears to be no controversy between the relevant parties regarding the content of the first order to be made in all four proceedings brought of course at the instance of the applicable applicant Nor is there controversy as to consequential orders numbered 4 to 7 concerning grant of leave to the applicant in all four proceedings to file the amended pleading and to the Commissioner filing a subsequent reply Where controversy lies is in relation to the nature and scope of the order required to give effective operation as to the implications of the strikeout of the foregoing paragraphs of amended statement of facts issues and contentions the proposed order 2 and to the order to be made as to costs of this motion and of the application for summary judgment the proposed order 3IEF contended the following in relation to the operation or implications otherwise of s 14ZZP concerning what is described therein as an appeal against an appealable objection decision under section 14ZZ    i the text of s 14ZZP refers to the making of orders in relation to the decision and so much usually involves the making of orders which either allow an appeal disallow an appeal or allow an appeal in part often with a direction to the Commissioner as to how to assess or otherwise deal with the matter in each of those cases however the order disposes of the whole of the objection decision and not just part of it and ii the section is expressed to operate where the appeal against the objection decision has been heard and by necessary implication has been determined it is only at that time that an order dealing with the whole of the objection decision may be made In short the contention of IEF seemingly boiled down to the proposition that since there can be only one objection decision or more precisely in the dicta of the Full Court in Commissioner of Taxation v Queensland Trading and Holding Company Limited 2006 FCAFC 112 Ryan Heerey and Edmonds JJ extracted in 10 below only one decision in respect of each objection there can only be an order of a court of competent jurisdiction made in relation to the whole of that objection decision Absent any statutory inhibition to the contrary more than one species or measure of relief may be available as a consequence of the exercise of what may be described as a statutory decisionThe appellate proceedings in the Full Federal Court in relation to the subject litigious context have not yet of course been heard or determined IEF submitted that the effect of the Courts ruling in relation to the Commissioners interlocutory strikeout motion the orders sought thereby being summarised in 3 of my reasons for judgment of 21 March 2006 is that IEF is estopped from challenging its liability to the primary tax controversially assessed by the Commissioner whether by reason of the doctrine of abuse of process or of estoppel That ruling of the Court in IEFs submission is procedural in nature the same not having constituted the concluded determination of the Commissioners objection decisions in relation to each corporate taxpayer ie each applicant by reason of the taxpayers pursuit of the subsisting appeals That being so IEF submitted further that the respective decisions of the Commissioner in relation to the objection to each assessment the same not being divisible or susceptible to partial setting aside in the manner contended by the Commissioner the appeals of each of the applicants inclusive of course of IEF cannot be partly dismissed I interpolate to observe for what it may presently matter that the primary basis for my upholding the Commissioners application for summary judgment was that of abuse of process albeit that I found further in favour of the Commissioner on the basis of estoppelSupport for the propositions so advanced by IEF was said to be found in the judicial reasoning of the Full Federal Court in Commissioner of Taxation v Queensland Trading and Holding Company Limited  where in the joint judgment of Ryan Heerey and Edmonds JJ the following appears at 20   As there can only be one objection by each of the taxpayers in respect of the assessment of primary tax and additional tax notified by the notice issued to each of them there can in our view be only one decision in respect of each objection and that is the objection referred to in s 14ZY of the Administration Act  The decision can accommodate both the disallowance of the objection or an allowance of it in whole or in part and in the latter case irrespective of whether it values reduction of the primary tax assessed further remission of the additional tax assessed or both  The emphasis appearing in the third and fourth lines above was that of IEF The issue here arising may be framed as to whether the order consequential upon a decision of the Commissioner may operate in the present context to the extent or of the scope framed by the Commissioner in 3 above or whether expression may only be given to my findings on 21 March 2006 in the way framed by the applicants in 3 above being a way for which incidentally no precedent was cited doubtless because of the unusual circumstances of the present proceedings involving not just more than a single year of income but three discrete taxpayer applicantsGiven the significance of the indivisibility of an objection decision for which it contended IEF submitted further that the appropriate course for adoption in order to give consequential effect should be for the Court to make an order or orders which would reflect the estoppel ruling but which would leave or postpone the formulation of an ultimate order or orders in relation to the respective objection decisions until the pending appeal has been heard and determined That outcome was submitted to be achievable by the adoption of what IEF proposed in terms of order 2 by way of an injunction aloneAs to order 3 proposed by the Commissioner which relates of course to the costs of the proceedings at first instance it was explained by IEF that it has adopted for the purpose of its approach the wording in the final line of my principal reasons being The Commissioner must have the costs of the proceedings to date inclusive of the costs related to the present summary application  IEF submitted that since the dispute between the parties regarding socalled penalty tax remains on foot and that much of the evidence in relation to that issue is common to the dispute already litigated at first instance regarding primary tax it was IEFs understanding that the Court was intending to refer thereby to so much only of the costs of the proceedings to date as related to the determination of the applicants taxable income for the relevant years of income that is to say those years of income the subject of the socalled estoppel point issue The practical difficulty in that regard would be the resolution of what work has been exclusively referrable to the penalty tax issue remaining for resolution as distinct from what work was referrable to the estoppel issue to the extent those distinctions were susceptible to being drawn for the particular purpose

PLACE SYDNEY  REASONS FOR ORDERS   On 21 March 2006 I directed the parties to the four subject proceedings  IEL Finance Limited and Others v Commissioner of Taxation 2006 62 ATR 165 to provide draft declarations andor orders giving effect to the reasons for judgment delivered on that prior occasion The first of those four proceedings being numbered NSD 539 of 2004 and involving IEL Finance Limited as applicant was treated by the parties as the precedent vehicle for the most part for implementation of orders to be made in the remaining three proceedings The abbreviations adopted in these reasons reflect those used in the preceding principal reasons for judgment of 21 March 2006 There appears to be no controversy between the relevant parties regarding the content of the first order to be made in all four proceedings brought of course at the instance of the applicable applicant Nor is there controversy as to consequential orders numbered 4 to 7 concerning grant of leave to the applicant in all four proceedings to file the amended pleading and to the Commissioner filing a subsequent reply Where controversy lies is in relation to the nature and scope of the order required to give effective operation as to the implications of the strikeout of the foregoing paragraphs of amended statement of facts issues and contentions the proposed order 2 and to the order to be made as to costs of this motion and of the application for summary judgment the proposed order 3The Commissioner submitted in response that the thrust of IEFs contentions I have outlined above tend to confuse the subject matter of the applicants respective applications in the principal proceedings with the subject matter of the Commissioners amended notice of motion filed on 25 July 2005 being summary relief for abuse of process The Commissioner drew attention however to Order 20 rule 2 subrule 1 whereof reads as follows    21 Where in any proceeding it appears to the Court that in relation to the proceeding generally or in relation to any claim for relief in the proceedings   a no reasonable cause of action is disclosed        c the proceeding is an abuse of the process of the Court the Court may order that the proceeding be stayed or dismissed generally or in relation to any claim for relief in the proceedings      Upon either footing and by reason moreover of ss 22 and 23 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 Cth the Federal Court Act the Commissioner asserted justification for an order in the form the subject of the Commissioners proposed Order 2 see again 3 above I was referred in that regard to the decision of Hunter v Leahy and Others 1999 FCA 1075  1999 91 FCR 214 where in relation to the operation of s 23 of the Federal Court Act French J observed at 14 and 15   14 It is accepted that courts of law and equity have general powers now accepted as an established part of their armoury to prevent the abuse or frustration of their processes in relation to matters coming within their jurisdictions       15 Although the term inherent jurisdiction was used to describe such a power in courts of general jurisdiction it is better described in a statutory court as an implied power The Commissioner emphasised that an order was not sought that part of the objection decision be affirmed but rather an order that the proceedings so far as they relate to the objection decision in respect of primary tax be dismissed and that whether the objection decision is to be affirmed or set aside in part is a matter that may be dealt with when the remaining issue the subject of the proceedings which relate to the objection decisions in respect of additional tax have been determined In my opinion and in the light in particular of the circumstance that the proceedings to date have been dominated by the issue as to liability to primary tax the Commissioners case in relation to the framework of the proposed Order 2 is to be preferredThe Federal Courts authority to make an order in relation to proceedings so far as the same may constitute an abuse of process does not originate from the Administration Act but under and pursuant to the inherent powers of the Court and of the Federal Court Rules  in conformity with which the orders sought by the Commissioner have been presented Moreover the power of the Court to make orders for the dismissal of proceedings in whole or in part originates under Order 20 rule 2 the concluding words whereof being reflected implicitly in the form of Order 2 proposed by the Commissioner in 3 above That power resides also in the power of the Federal Court conferred by s 23 of the Federal Court Act as the dictum of French J in Hunter makes clear For ease of reference section 23 reads as follows   The Court has power in relation to matters in which it has jurisdiction to make orders of such kinds including interlocutory orders and to issue or direct the issue of writs of such kinds as the Court thinks appropriateIt is upon that footing which I pointed out in 126 of my reasons for judgment given on 21 March 2006 in the strikeout proceedings  supra  being my primary juridical basis for granting or upholding the Commissioners

06_1294.xml,c1,cited,VBAP of 2002 v Minister of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 965,In my opinion that submission must be accepted There might be some cases where a tribunal of this kind considering questions of this kind could fall into jurisdictional error in respect of an aspect of its deliberations which would not affect the ultimate conclusion VBAP of 2002 v Minister of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs 2005 FCA 965 was one of these However this matter is differentThere were a number of issues before the Tribunal which needed to be resolved First whether the appellants were subject to persecution secondly whether they had a fear of persecution thirdly whether the fear of persecution was well founded fourthly whether there was adequate state protection available to the appellants and fifthly whether the appellants could be relocated so as to avoid any form of persecutionThe question of relocation cannot be considered in a vacuum if in fact there is no adequate state protection available to the appellants The question of relocation must always depend upon there being available adequate state protection Because the Federal Magistrate found the Tribunal had fallen into error in relation to the question of state protection it seems to me the Tribunals decision cannot stand The first respondent has not challenged the Federal Magistrates reasons in relation to the Tribunals error in relation to state protection
06_1295.xml,c0,discussed,Appellant S395 of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 71 ; (2003) 216 CLR 473,The Chief Federal Magistrate was alleged to have erred in failing to grant constitutional writ relief or prerogative relief on the following bases first that the Tribunal had committed a jurisdictional error in failing correctly to identify the appellants claims and to apply the decision in Appellant S395 of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs 2003 HCA 71  2003 216 CLR 473 Secondly that in reaching its conclusion the Tribunal failed to give the appellant a notice in writing under s 424A1 of the Migration Act 1958 Cth of information which it took into account which was not information that fell within an exception found in subs 3 of that sectionThe information was characterised in two ways first that the appellant in her protection visa application had not made clear to the Tribunal how she would practice Falun Gong if she returned to China and secondly that while she had said that she had a fear of persecution on the other hand she had offered very little in support of that Each type of information was said to be information within the meaning of s 424A1 in the manner I will explain in more detail shortly The third ground was that the Tribunal had erred in the exercise of its discretion under s 426A when it failed to consider making contact with or contacting the appellant after she had failed to attend a hearing in circumstances where previously she had advised the Tribunal that she did intend to attendThe appellant had arrived in Australia in February 1997 In August 2000 she had lodged an application for a protection visa with the Minister A delegate of the Minister refused to grant her a protection visa in September 2000 and she applied for a review of that decision on 3 October 2000 The basis of her claim was set out in a statement which she made in the application for the visa She said that she had become a practitioner of Falun Gong in May 1998 in AustraliaShe pointed to the fact that as far as she knew all Falun Gong practitioners suffered persecution in China and that many of them had been jailed many detained and those who might not be detained or arrested could be suffering mentally from discrimination and could have been discriminated against by the Chinese authorities in their employment or through some forms of administrative punishment In her claims she explained that she attended a Falun Dafa Australian experience sharing convention in May 1998 and thereafter became attracted to the practice of Falun GongShe said that she claimed to have gone to Darling Harbour every Saturday and that she had read books by a master of Falun Gong and obeyed the other laws of that set of beliefs She claimed that by practising Falun Gong her health became better and she had received mental cultivation and enlightenment She also claimed to have attended another Falun Dafa Australian experience sharing conference in May 1999 and then in May 2000 to have participated in what she said was the worlds first Falun Dafa day in Australia On that occasion she said that with approximately 300 other practitioners she had walked from Hyde Park in Sydney to Darling Harbour and had held up banners with laudatory statements about Falun DafaIn Appellant S395 of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs 2003 HCA 71  2003 216 CLR 473 at 489 40 McHugh and Kirby JJ said   Persecution covers many forms of harm ranging from physical harm to the loss of intangibles from death and torture to State sponsored or condoned discrimination in social life and employment Whatever form the harm takes it will constitute persecution only if by reason of its intensity or duration a person persecuted cannot reasonably be expected to tolerate it But persecution does not cease to be persecution for the purpose of the Convention because those persecuted can eliminate the harm by taking avoiding action within the country of nationalityThe real problem in this case is that the appellant made claims that she was a Falun Gong practitioner that she wished to practice if she were to return to China and that she would be placed at risk But she had failed to satisfy the Tribunal on the material she placed before it of the way in which she was proposing to practice if returned so that it could be apparent whether or not she would be put in a position on either of the two horns of the dilemma which she presented to the Tribunal or of being a person who would be forced to modify the way in which she practised her beliefs to escape coming to the attention of the authoritiesWhile other decision makers may have viewed her claims differently from the way in which the Tribunal did it was for the Tribunal to be satisfied of them or not I see no error in the way in which it exercised its function of review that affected the jurisdictional foundation on which the Tribunal proceeded I am of opinion that the Tribunal did look at what has been called the dilemma albeit without expressly identifying it in the passage to which I have referred in which it ultimately said that it was not clear how the appellant would practice Falun Gong were she returned to China and therefore it could not be clear to the Tribunal whether she would be affected at all and if so in what manner

06_1295.xml,c2,followed,Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang (1996)185 CLR 259,It is important in considering the reasons of the Tribunal that the court should not be concerned with the looseness in language or unhappy phrasing Its reasons are not to be construed minutely and with an eye keenly tuned to a perception of error As Brennan CJ Toohey McHugh and Gummow JJ said in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang 1996 HCA 6  1996 185 CLR 259 at 272 the reality is that the reasons of administrative decisionmakers are meant to inform and not to be scrutinised upon over zealous judicial review by seeming to discern whether some inadequacy may be gleaned from the way in which the reasons are expressed Relevantly for seeking the present context their Honours said    any court reviewing a decision upon refugee status must beware of turning a review of the reasons of the decisionmaker upon proper principles into a reconsideration of the merits of the decisionAn administrative decision which involves jurisdictional error is regarded in law as no decision at all Plaintiff S1572002 v The Commonwealth 2003 HCA 2  2003 211 CLR 476 at 506 76 citing Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Bhardwaj 2002 HCA 11  2002 209 CLR 597 at 614615 51 per Gaudron and Gummow JJ at 618 63 McHugh and at 646647 152 per Hayne J In the latter case the Tribunal had failed to have drawn to its attention at the time it made its decision a communication from the applicant for review that he was unable to attend because of illness It later embarked on a further review of his case and the court upheld that exercise on the ground that the Tribunal initially had not performed a review at all because it failed to have regard to the applicant for reviews communication to it and had not decided in accordance with the Act
06_1295.xml,c3,considered,Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SZFHC [2006] FCAFC 73,Here the Act gave the Tribunal the discretion to proceed or not once the appellant did not appear on 22 March 2001 The Tribunal did not have to give reasons for its exercise of discretion under s 426A because s 430 of the Act did not require it to do so In Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SZFHC 2006 FCAFC 73 at 27  the full court held that where the Tribunal had sent to an applicant for a review at his address for service a letter inviting him to a hearing in accordance with ss 425 and 425A in circumstances where s 422B was not then in force the mere fact that the Tribunal received the letter back with a return to sender endorsement did not oblige the Tribunal to do anything further to search in its files to see other addresses at which the applicant may be contacted Their Honours said 2006 FCAFC 73 3839   The respondent says the Tribunal was on notice that he may not have received the letter because the Response to Hearing Invitation form was not returned because the letter to his residential address was returned unclaimed and because he did not appear at the hearing The respondent says that in these circumstances the Tribunal was obliged under s 425 to search both its own and the Department file to attempt to find another method of contacting the respondent He says that in this case the Tribunal had an obligation to contact the migration agent listed if the respondents Department file to find more recent contact details and possibly also to ring the residential telephone number contained in the respondents protection visa application   The submissions of the respondent in this respect are rejected In view of the decision in VNAA it is clear that ss 425 and 425A of the Migration Act are to be read together Accordingly the Tribunal having complied with one of the methods prescribed in s 425A in fact two was under no further obligation to search the papers lodged with it to discover if there might be some other avenue of communicating with the applicantThe appellant distinguishes that decision on the basis that this matter had proceeded one stage further in that the appellant had been contacted and had indicated she wished to attend the hearing The obligation under s 425  at the time at which the appellants claim came to be considered by the Tribunal was to invite the appellant to appear before it to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review That was complied with Whether the appellant took up the invitation seems to me to be a matter for the appellant at the end of the day The Tribunals obligation had been dischargedI think that a construction of s 426A1 that obliged the Tribunal to accord natural justice to an applicant for review if they did not appear in accordance with s 426A1b  was at odds with the express words of the discretion in the section Those words are that   It may make a decision on the review without taking any further action to allow or enable the applicant to appear before itIt seems to me to be quite inconsistent with those words to construe the obligations of procedural fairness to require the decision maker to give the applicant an opportunity to retrieve his or her position after a failure to appear in that situation
06_1295.xml,c4,discussed,NAJT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 134 ; (2005) 147 FCR 51,The appellant also referred to the decision of the Full Court in NAJT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs 2005 FCAFC 134  2005 147 FCR 51 There Madgwick J with whom Conti J agreed had noted that the court could reasonably attribute to the delegate whose decision was then under challenge knowledge of the notorious background facts about China that it was an authoritarian indeed a politically though not now economically totalitarian State see 147 FCR at 94 220 He said that while the delegate in that case had accepted apparently that active proponents or leaders of Falun Gong as opposed to ordinary practitioners would be more likely to come to the attention of the authorities in the circumstances of that case the appellants claims as to events in Australia indicated that she in fact had been an active proponent of Falun Gong In those circumstance the delegates express lack of satisfaction that she had been identified by Chinese authorities could hardly have betokened any confident and complete rejection of that proposition This led to a finding that the decision maker in that case had misunderstood the task which he was required to undertake see 147 FCR 9495 221222I do not think that the facts of that case are sufficiently analogous or in point on the present facts to lead to a conclusion in support of the first groundFor these reasons I therefore reject the first groundTurning to the second ground it was said that the provisions of s 424A1 were engaged so as to require the Tribunal to give the appellant notice in writing that it intended to use as the reason or part of the reason for affirming the decision under review parts of its reasoning or fact finding as to how the appellant may or may not practice Falun Gong and the Tribunals lack of satisfaction about that were she to return to China Further and alternatively it was argued that the Tribunal should have given her notice that it would use the fact or reasoning that she had offered very little support for those claims even in the form of evidence which she herself could give
06_1295.xml,c5,followed,NBBL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1045,I am fortified in this construction of s 426A by a decision of Greenwood J in NBBL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs 2006 FCA 1045  especially at 24 The matter may also be tested by considering whether if the Tribunal had decided to make attempts to contact the appellant on her failure to attend on 21 March 2001 the Minister could have attacked that conduct on the ground that a jurisdictional error occurred In my opinion it could notIt was plain that the Tribunal had a discretion one way or the other to decide whether or not to take further action I do not think that it could be inferred or implied that the requirements of procedural fairness necessitated the Tribunal in arriving at a decision under s 426A1 to consider contacting the appellant and if it failed to do so the whole of the exercise of its jurisdiction would be thrown into doubt The very terms of the section seem to me to negate such an approachI do not see any error in the way in which the Chief Federal Magistrate approached this issue For these reasons I reject this ground

06_1295.xml,c7,followed,SZEZI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1195,In SZEZI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs 2005 FCA 1195 Allsop J referred to the reasons a Tribunal had given in that case that the appellant had not provided the level of detail necessary satisfactorily to establish the relevant facts in his case The Tribunal there noted that questions remained unanswered as to how and when the homosexuality which he there alleged had come about and become known and the like At the end the Tribunal concluded it was not satisfied that the appellants claims were true His Honour said 2005 FCA 1195 at 29   The Tribunal having read all the material and having evaluated its content and weight was unable to reach a specified mental state It was not satisfied that the appellant had a wellfounded fear because of subjectively perceived inadequacies in the information The reason for the decision was simply and no more than that the evaluative conclusion founded on the perceived inadequacy of the information in the sense of an absence of detail and extrinsic explanation which had been invited It would be an inadequate and misleading statement to say that the information was the reason or part of the reason for the decision It was the lack of the requested further assistance and explanation that was the reasonAccordingly his Honour found that in that case there was no failure to comply with s 424A Although my mind has wavered on the point I am of opinion that the better view is that the Tribunals use of the failure of the appellant to give evidence is to be viewed in a similar fashion At the end of the day the Tribunal concluded that on the very limited information available it was not satisfied that the appellant would be at risk of persecution were she to return to China or that there was any real chance that she would be persecuted if she did Notwithstanding my doubts I find that the Tribunal was not obliged to give a notice under s 424A1 and that I should dismiss this ground of appealLast it is said that the Tribunal failed to exercise a discretion under s 426A1 in accordance with the Act and thereby committed a jurisdictional error The appellant argues that the Tribunal ought to have had regard to the fact that she had indicated she wished to attend a hearing but because she did not arrive it ought to have taken the simple step of telephoning her on the telephone number which the Tribunal had to ascertain whether or not there was some reason for her nonattendanceI am asked to infer from material in the appellants affidavit which was unchallenged before his Honour that had she been telephoned on the day of the hearing she would have attended the hearing andor made arrangements to seek an adjournment with the Tribunal The appellant did not state that explicitly in her affidavit of 16 March 2006 I infer that she had considerable concerns about her immigration status and continued to liaise and speak with people at the Shine Business Consultant Centre at all relevant times While I might be prepared to infer in her favour that she would in fact have communicated to the Tribunal that she wanted a hearing and sought to arrange a convenient time either on the day fixed for the hearing or at some other time the first question is what was the scope of the discretionary power in s 426AThe Minister submits that considerations which the Tribunal was bound to take into account are those specified in s 426A1a and b namely that a proper invitation had been given to the appellant to appear at a hearing before the Tribunal under s 425 and the appellant had not appeared before the Tribunal on the day on which or at the time and place at which she was scheduled to appear The Minister argues that s 426A2 is in effect facultative in allowing the Tribunal to reschedule the time of an appellants appearance to enable him or her to appear at a later or an alternate time but that subs 2 does not in effect create some consideration which the Tribunal is bound to take into account in exercising its discretion
06_1295.xml,c8,referred_to,SZHSQ v Minister for Immigration [2006] FMCA 538,This is an appeal from a decision of the Federal Magistrates Court SZHSQ v Minister for Immigration 2006 FMCA 538 In essence three principal bases of error were argued before meI am of opinion that although the reasons of the Tribunal could have been better expressed the Chief Federal Magistrate made no error in his conclusion that the Tribunal had made no finding that the appellant was a practitioner of Falun Gong or that she had practised that faith in a particular way He said that there was no finding that upon her return to China she would practice in a particular way and that it was apparent that the Tribunal was unable to make those findings because of her non attendance before the it and the lack of information in support of her claim see 2006 FMCA 538 at 16 From time to time decisions of the Tribunal refer to questions which it might have been able to ask of persons had they attended hearings The courts have held that that speculation does not amount to a jurisdictional error or a failure to comply with s 424A1 I am mindful that in this case the requirements of the Act for according natural justice are not exhaustive because what came later to be enacted in s 422B was not in force at the time the Tribunal made its decision Thus the common law requirements of procedural fairness to the extent that they are consistent with the Act had to be observed by the Tribunal in addition to those mandated in the statute I am of opinion that the Tribunal did take into account the fact that the appellant had not given evidence in support of her claims and the fact that she did not attend the hearing as information to why it would find against her The Chief Federal Magistrate thought this ground in totality was misconceived see 2006 FMCA 538 at 19 In one sense in every case where an applicant for review does not attend a hearing part of the material before the Tribunal is the failure to attend and to give evidence in support of the claim But here the Tribunal gave as a reason that the appellant had in effect not only given little support to her claims she had not given evidence to support them At no time did the Tribunal give notice to the appellant that her failure to give evidence in support of her claims would be a reason for rejecting them Rather it had sent a notice saying that it was not satisfied on the material before it that it could make a decision in her favour and invited her to a hearing as it was required under the Act to do before it could proceed along that courseTo employ the appellants failure to give evidence in support of her claims as a part of the reason why her claim should not be accepted seems to me to be using that information against her in a way that she was not advised of beforehand Albeit she was on notice that the Tribunal was not going to make a decision in her favour it was not because she had not given evidence It was because the Tribunal was not satisfied on the material that she had presented to it The distinction is fine and difficult and I am not entirely sure that it is satisfactory given that the Act envisages that the very purpose of inviting someone to a hearing is to enable them to persuade by what they can say and provide at the hearing the Tribunal against upholding the decision to refuse a visa

06_1296.xml,c0,considered,NBGM v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 60,14 The appellant argues that the RRT did not treat the views expressed by commentators as being the test for application of Article 1C5 In support of this the appellant refers to the recent decision of the Full Federal Court in NBGM v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs 2006 FCAFC 60 at 184 where Allsop J with whom a majority of other judges agreed said  The approach is not to ask whether a claim of such a wellfounded fear has been made out but to ask whether in respect of someone who has been recognised as a refugee that is who has made out that claim circumstances have so changed as to warrant the conclusion that the wellfounded fear which previously existed can no longer be maintained as a basis for refusing to avail himself or herself of the protection of the country of nationality and so that the protection of the Convention should cease A lack of demonstrable clarity in the reality and durability of the change in relevant circumstances will lead to the grounds for cessation not being established  Emphasis added15 I accept that for the purpose of the present case the emphasised formulation of the test is appropriate and that this was the test addressed by the RRT16 The appellant submits that the observation by the RRT that the expressions of the commentators which were to similar effect as the approach later enunciated by Allsop J do not constitute legal tests evidences that the wrong test was applied by the RRT17 I do not accept this submission The correct test is enunciated by the RRT The RRT rightly notes that it is important to return the language of the Convention and there is no reason to doubt that the RRT has done this The use of the expression legal tests does not signify that the RRT has adopted a different or inconsistent approach but rather that it was conscious of the need to apply the language of the Act  On a fair reading of the reasons I consider that the RRT has sought to apply and has formulated the correct approach to the question while at the same time bearing in mind the importance of giving primacy to the language of the Convention18 In addition the appellant submits that in the application of the test to the circumstances of the case the RRT has not correctly applied the test because it has ignored a number of relevant circumstances36 The respondent relies on the recent decision of the Full Federal Court in NBGM v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs 2006 FCAFC 60 Black CJ Mansfield and Stone JJ agreed that s 363 5 had to be satisfied in respect of an application for a permanent protection visa where the person had been previously accepted as a refugee at an earlier time Black CJ at 25 referred to the concurrence of Mansfield J at 59 and Stone J at 149 in these terms    whilst there are two lines of reasoning leading to the majority conclusion that the appeal should be dismissed there is a common conclusion about the task to be performed by the decisionmaker on an application for a permanent protection visa where the relevant circumstances are said to have changed since the appellant was granted a temporary protection visa  The majority would agree that s 36 mandates that the decisionmaker must be satisfied that at the time the decision is made the appellant for a permanent protection visa then has a wellfounded fear of persecution for a Convention reason The circumstance that a previous decisionmaker was satisfied that the applicant had such a fear when a temporary protection visa was granted is not sufficient to establish what s 36 requires Emphasis added37 In my view the above statement of principle by the majority accords with a reasonable interpretation of the language of s 363 5 In terms s 362 requires that whenever there is an application for a protection visa of any kind the Minister must be satisfied that Australia has protection obligations to the applicant Subsections 3 4 and 5 expressly exclude the operation of such obligations unless the person has a wellfounded fear of persecution on Convention grounds These provisions are in terms calculated to enliven a requirement that there must exist a wellfounded fear where a new claim is made for a protection visa The making of the claim expressly activates the requirement and this is not displaced by generalised overtones which are said to emerge inferentially from the terms of Article 1C5 when that provision did not contemplate legislative modifications of the type enacted in s 3638 The above statement in NBGM is the most recent Full Court statement on the question as to the interpretation and interaction between s 36 as amended and Article 1C5 and I am bound by this expression of principle I note that special leave has been granted by the High Court in relation to that proceeding and that the High Court has recently heard the appeal and reserved its decision39 In these circumstances the appellant submits that the reasons of Wilcox and Madgwick JJ in the earlier Full Court case QAAH v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs 2005 FCAFC 136  2005 145 FCR 363 should be followed and applied In that case the majority held that if the decisionmaker is satisfied that an applicant has already been recognised as a refugee under Art 1A2 of the Convention and is not satisfied that this status has ceased under Art 1C5 then Australia will have protection obligations to the applicant The appellant says that on a correct reading NBGM has no ratiodecidendi and therefore no application or alternatively that it is authority contrary to the position of the respondent It is argued that on a correct analysis it can be seen that Stone J arrived at her decision in her separate reasons on a basis inconsistent with reasoning of Black CJ and Mansfield J The appellant submits that for this reason and notwithstanding her Honours statement at 149 expressing her agreement with the proposition set out therein the position as articulated in 25 of Black CJs reasons should not be followed Therefore it is said the majority decision in QAAH correctly expresses the law and must be applied40 Where recently three members of a fivemember Full Court have expressly committed to a specific statement of principle as being applicable to the question before me I consider that I should follow that statement In my view the position as stated by Black CJ in 25 cannot be said to be clearly wrong The question before me is not to be resolved by arcane dissection and analysis of the chains of reasoning by each of the five different members of the Court of the type which has been adopted in the arguments in relation to the ratiodecidendi of NBGM  The concurrence of the majority judges in the statement as to the interpretation and application of s 36 as amended is conclusive for the determination of the question before me on this issue41 The consequence of this in the present case is that I am not persuaded the RRT has erred in requiring that it must be satisfied that the appellant had a wellfounded fear of persecution or in finding that the appellant did not have a wellfounded fear of persecution for a Convention reason Nor have I been pointed to any error in the reasons of Emmett FM that would warrant the setting aside of this decision The appeal is therefore dismissed with costs   I certify that the preceding fortyone 41 numbered paragraphs

06_1297.xml,c0,referred_to,Allstate Life Insurance Co & Ors v Australian & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd & Ors [1995] FCA 660,As to the operation of Order 62 rule 3 upon the issues the subject of the current interlocutory proceedings Wieland made the submission that an order pursuant to O 62 r 3 whereby the Court exercises its discretion as to costs requires material sufficient to warrant a departure from the general practice that costs ordered in interlocutory proceedings should await the outcome of the proceedings Wieland addressed Readymixs reliance on the observations of Lindgren J in Allstate Life Insurance Co  Ors v Australia  New Zealand Banking Group Ltd  Ors 1995 FCA 660  where his Honour observed that where litigation is complex and parties may face a delay in recovering their costs there exists a basis for consideration departing from the usual course Wieland contended nevertheless that the applicants in these proceedings have not pointed to any basis for suggesting that these proceedings will be excessively delayed Contrary to that contention by Wieland however there is persuasive force in Readymixs submission that one is entitled to start with the proposition that the respondent in the conduct of its defence has caused egregious delay and that the delay in the progress of the proceedings logically delays resolution of the proceedings when the applicants would in the ordinary course be entitled to the assessment of costs awarded in its favourI am of the view that Readymix is entitled to an order in its favour in relation to its costs thrown away by the postponement of the final hearing inclusive of those costs of and incidental to the present application of Readymix the subject of the notices of motions of Readymix filed respectively on 30 August 2006 7 September 2006 and on 12 September 2006 the scope whereof I would observe tend to overlap Whether any category of legal costs incurred by Readymix otherwise than that of a party and party basis should qualify within the scope of the order for costs is a more difficult consideration The costs of Readymix thrown away would appear to be in principle those relating to professional work undertaken and disbursements incurred as a result of steps implemented by Readymixs legal representatives to arrange inspection of the SLP 1100 crusher then located in Melbourne and to obtain expert reports in relation thereto including in principle costs relating to Mr Betters fees and disbursements to the extent to which the same can rightly be described as thrown away as well as costs associated with the vacation of the hearing Whether the costs incurred of and incidentally to the mediation incurred by Readymix should be included is a moot point but I would disincline in principle to include in any event costs of the intervening mediationI am further of the opinion that in the exercise of the Courts authority and discretion pursuant to Order 62 rule 3 of the Federal Court Rules as to formulating orders as to costs at a stage of the proceedings prior to finalisation Wieland should be ordered in principle to make payment forthwith of the costs the subject of the orders presently under consideration I favour that outcome notwithstanding that the principal proceedings are not of course concluded My present estimate is that an amount equal to two thirds thereof would be appropriate but I would in any event grant liberty to apply to either party on seven days notice should injustice or imponderable uncertainty be contended to arise in relation to any such quantification I say at least because the existing order as to security shall require revision in any event so as to exclude quantification of the costs attributable to Wielands radical misunderstanding earlier discussed

facilities and other things comprising the project In summary it was said that Professor Garnauts evidence demonstrates the economic and commercial reality of treating the hedge expenses as being in

particular word or words in the PRRTA Act The term economic rent appears nowhere in the Act nor does the term resources rent tax save for the title to the Act In particular the Act does not contain any explicitly economic terms whose application to a particular case would be assisted by economic evidence By explicitly economic terms I mean words such as market and competition which appear in Pt IV of the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth In proceedings under Pt IV of that Act the evidence of economists may be relied upon to aid in the identification of the relevant market and judgments about the effects historic or predictive of particular conduct on competition in a market 53 Re Michael concerned the application of statutory and Gas Access Code provisions to the determination of an access tariff for a gas pipeline Parker J Malcolm CJ and Anderson J agreeing referred to some of the terms of the relevant Act and the Code as being in common use in that field of economics which is concerned with competition policy or more particularly with the regulation of essential infrastructure at 107 His Honour observed that these words or phrases conveyed a meaning to those familiar with the field of economics differing from that which the words themselves would suggest in ordinary everyday usage He said at 107   As the subject matter is by nature conceptual there is no uniform accepted and certain meaning but there is a principle or theory the essential tenets of which are widely understood though there need not be uniform acceptance of them In my view expert evidence may relevantly and usefully inform the court as to this specialised usage of which the court would otherwise be unaware so that the court can determine whether the Act and Code is using particular words or phrases in their ordinary everyday usage or in the specialised usage among those versed in this field of economics  Importantly his Honour continued at 107    Further the expert evidence provides an appreciation of the nature and objectives of competition policy in the field of economics and in particular of the regulation of essential infrastructure so that the policy and objectives of the Act can be discerned with a greater and more reliable appreciation of the possibilities In addition the potential relevance of some concepts and provisions in the Act and Code can be more readily understood    In Visa  Tamberlin J observed in relation to Re Michael and other cases involving admissibility of expert economic evidence at 665   The emphasis in these cases is on informing and assisting the court with a view to illuminating an understanding of the terms used in relation to the issues raised His Honour also agreed with Lindgren J in Allstate Life Insurance Co v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd No 6 1996 64 FCR 79 that generally it is not for an expert to give evidence as to the application of a legislative provision as opposed to furnishing evidence from the viewpoint of an economist with respect to what factors can or should be taken into consideration or ignored   It is also appropriate to note his Honours prudential observation with which I agree that at 669   In ruling on the admissibility of the expert evidence at an early stage of the hearing I was conscious that there can be substantial difficulties particularly in relation to issues of relevance and appreciating the overall context against which to properly or fully consider admissibility The general approach which I took was to err on the side of admitting evidence which was on or close to the borderline on the basis that such evidence if admitted could be evaluated as to substance and weight in final submissions    Professor Garnauts evidence assumes that the Act is intended to tax economic rent as he explains that term The company relies upon various extrinsic materials antedating the passage of the Act as indicative of that purpose Assuming that purpose is made out then Professor Garnaut offers what amounts to the inference that the overall objective of the Act is to generate revenue without distorting business decisions on the amount or composition of investment or production This identified purpose is relied upon to assist the Court to decide in the first place whether the contentious hedging losses were expenses payable by Woodside Energy in relation to the sale of petroleum within the meaning of s 24a of the PRRTA Act Assuming that the hedging losses are properly to be called expenses the question reduces to whether they are expenses in relation to the sale The words in relation to and similar terms like in respect of or in connection with or just in have been considered in many cases and many contexts They denote a necessary connection between two subject matters which may be activities events persons or things The nature and closeness or remoteness of the connection depends upon context In Workers Compensation Board Qld v Technical Products Proprietary Limited 1988 HCA 49  1988 165 CLR 642 the term in respect of was said to have a wide meaning It  gathers meaning from the context in which it appears and it is that context which will determine the matters to which it extends at 653654 per Deane Dawson and Toohey JJ The words in relation to have been described as a prepositional phrase which is indefinite and which subject to any contrary indication derived from its context or drafting history  requires no more than a relationship whether direct or indirect between two subject matters OGrady v North Queensland Company Limited 1990 HCA 16  1990 169 CLR 356 at 376 McHugh J The term is indefinite and will not generally apply to any relationship no matter how remote The extent of the relationship required will depend upon the context in which the words are used Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Maritime Union of Australia 2001 FCA 1549  2001 114 FCR 472 at 482 Hill J and authorities there cited Two things may stand in relation to each other in a variety of ways The relationship may be spatial temporal or causal It may be a relationship of similarity or difference Relationships between things in the law do not simply exist to await discovery They are defined by the common law or by legislation and their authoritative interpreters The criteria by which a statutory test of relationship is to be applied will have to be relevant to and serve the purposes of the statute The relationship between claimed expenses and the sale of petroleum products in s 24a of the PRRTA Act cannot be the subject of a bright line definition covering all cases but it must lie within the bounds of relevance to the statutory purpose If that purpose can be explained or elucidated by reference to a recognised economic mechanism to which the Act is intended to give effect then expert evidence about the operating principles of that mechanism can be received Such evidence may not be material directly concerned with interpretation of provisions of the Act as is extrinsic material received pursuant to s 15AB of the Acts Interpretation Act  Nor can it justify any application of the Act beyond the bounds set by its language But it may help to identify the purpose of the statute and thus inform the application of ambulatory terms in it such as in relation to in s 24a The preceding observations do not import any concluded view about whether the assumption on which Professor Garnaut will base his evidence is made out That will require a closer consideration of the terms of the Act and the extrinsic materials relevant to its interpretation It is better done in the context of all the evidence including the extrinsic materials relied upon I am not prepared to rule Professor Garnauts evidence inadmissible I take it as evidence rather than as submission in that it purports to demonstrate that the economic mechanism to which the PRRTA Act is said to give effect would treat hedging losses as expenses in the way for which Woodside Energy contends If some of his evidence trespasses into argument I will simply treat it as such I do not regard him as offering evidence on the ultimate issue even if that were a difficulty Rather it proposes that a certain treatment of hedging losses would advance the purpose of the statute viewed in the light of the economic theory which underpins it I will therefore admit the evidence proposed to be called from Professor Garnaut Ultimately this is a decision about relevance It may be that in the light of further evidence and argument his evidence will be shown to be based upon a false assumption If that is so then it may be that it will be rejected as irrelevant I am not prepared to find on the materials presently before me that the assumption upon which he advances his evidence has been falsified It seems to me to be at least arguably relevant and so will be admitted  The admissibility of the evidence of Professor Walker   It is well established that evidence of accounting practice may be admitted in revenue cases so that the Court has the opportunity to characterise such things as receipts and payments for the purposes of the relevant statute by reference to accounting and commercial realities That is not to say that such evidence can displace the words of the statute Nor does it involve the expert witness in interpreting the statute But where as in this case there are terms used of indefinite import such as in relation to incurred  in relation to and made  in carrying on  operations then such evidence may properly inform their application having regard to the purpose of the statute and the context in which the provision appears In Rowe and Son Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation 1970 HCA 57  1971 124 CLR 421 Gibbs J referred to expert evidence that it was unusual to bring into the accounts of a trader making sales on terms only the payments received or receivable in the year in question and that to do so would not record the true position of the trading In connection with such evidence generally he said at 452   When the ITAA gives no directions on the point the question when income is earned and the method of accounting to be adopted for the purpose of ascertaining the income depend upon business conceptions and the principles and practices of accountancy   In BHP Billiton Professor Walker gave evidence as to the proper accounting treatment to be adopted in the accounts of a corporation such as BHP Billiton The passage from the judgment of Gibbs J quoted above was quoted in the joint judgment of Hill and Heerey JJ at 134   In Ogilvy Mather Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation 1990 95 ALR 663 Hill J in the Full Court referred to expert evidence which had been adduced from a professor of accounting and said at 703   Accounting evidence cannot be substituted for the test laid down by s 511 FCT v James Flood Pty Ltd 1953 HCA 65  1953 88 CLR 492 at 5067 Nevertheless as the Full Court of this court pointed out in Hooker Rex Pty Ltd v FCT 88 ATC 4392 at 4399    the tendency of judicial decision has been to place increasing reliance upon the concepts of business and the principles and practices of commercial accountancy not only in the ascertainment of income but also in the ascertainment of expenditure DCT SA v Executor Trustee and Agency Co of South Australia Ltd 1938 HCA 69  1938 63 CLR 108 at 153 FCT v Australian Guarantee Corp Ltd 1984 54 ALR 209 84 ATC 4642    Applying the prudential approach adopted by Tamberlin J in the Visa case to which I referred earlier I am of the opinion that Professor Walkers evidence should be admitted as arguably relevant to the application of the terms to which I have referred and the proper characterisation of the hedging losses in the context of the provisions to which I have referred  Conclusion   For the preceding reasons the evidence of Professors Garnaut and Walker will be admitted at the hearing  I certify that the

production This identified purpose is relied upon to assist the Court to decide in the first place whether the contentious hedging losses were expenses payable by Woodside Energy in relation to the sale of petroleum within the meaning of s 24a of the PRRTA Act Assuming that the hedging losses are properly to be called expenses the question reduces to whether they are expenses in relation to the sale The words in relation to and similar terms like in respect of or in connection with or just in have been considered in many cases and many contexts They denote a necessary connection between two subject matters which may be activities events persons or things The nature and closeness or remoteness of the connection depends upon context In Workers Compensation Board Qld v Technical Products Proprietary Limited 1988 HCA 49  1988 165 CLR 642 the term in respect of was said to have a wide meaning It  gathers meaning from the context in which it appears and it is that context which will determine the matters to which it extends at 653654 per Deane Dawson and Toohey JJ The words in relation to have been described as a prepositional phrase which is indefinite and which subject to any contrary indication derived from its context or drafting history  requires no more than a relationship whether direct or indirect between two subject matters OGrady v North Queensland Company Limited 1990 HCA 16  1990 169 CLR 356 at 376 McHugh J The term is indefinite and will not generally apply to any relationship no matter how remote The extent of the relationship required will depend upon the context in which the words are used Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Maritime Union of Australia 2001 FCA 1549  2001 114 FCR 472 at 482 Hill J and authorities there cited Two things may stand in relation to each other in a variety of ways The relationship may be spatial temporal or causal It may be a relationship of similarity or difference Relationships between things in the law do not simply exist to await discovery They are defined by the common law or by legislation and their authoritative interpreters The criteria by which a statutory test of relationship is to be applied will have to be relevant to and serve the purposes of the statute The relationship between claimed expenses and the sale of petroleum products in s 24a of the PRRTA Act cannot be the subject of a bright line definition covering all cases but it must lie within the bounds of relevance to the statutory purpose If that purpose can be explained or elucidated by reference to a recognised economic mechanism to which the Act is intended to give effect then expert evidence about the operating principles of that mechanism can be received Such evidence may not be material directly concerned with interpretation of provisions of the Act as is extrinsic material received pursuant to s 15AB of the Acts Interpretation Act  Nor can it justify any application of the Act beyond the bounds set by its language But it may help to identify the purpose of the statute and thus inform the application of ambulatory terms in it such as in relation to in s 24a The preceding observations do not import any concluded view about whether the assumption on which Professor Garnaut will base his evidence is made out That will require a closer consideration of the terms of the Act and the extrinsic materials relevant to its interpretation It is better done in the context of all the evidence including the extrinsic materials relied upon I am not prepared to rule Professor Garnauts evidence inadmissible I take it as evidence rather than as submission in that it purports to demonstrate that the economic mechanism to which the PRRTA Act is said to give effect would treat hedging losses as expenses in the way for which Woodside Energy contends If some of his evidence trespasses into argument I will simply treat it as such I do not regard him as offering evidence on the ultimate issue even if that were a difficulty Rather it proposes that a certain treatment of hedging losses would advance the purpose of the statute viewed in the light of the economic theory which underpins it I will therefore admit the evidence proposed to be called from Professor Garnaut Ultimately this is a decision about relevance It may be that in the light of further evidence and argument his evidence will be shown to be based upon a false assumption If that is so then it may be that it will be rejected as irrelevant I am not prepared to find on the materials presently before me that the assumption upon which he advances his evidence has been falsified It seems to me to be at least arguably relevant and so will be admitted  The admissibility of the evidence of Professor Walker   It is well established that evidence of accounting practice may be admitted in revenue cases so that the Court has the opportunity to characterise such things as receipts and payments for the purposes of the relevant statute by reference to accounting and commercial realities That is not to say that such evidence can displace the words of the statute Nor does it involve the expert witness in interpreting the statute But where as in this case there are terms used of indefinite import such as in relation to incurred  in relation to and made  in carrying on  operations then such evidence may properly inform their application having regard to the purpose of the statute and the context in which the provision appears In Rowe and Son Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation 1970 HCA 57  1971 124 CLR 421 Gibbs J referred

Garnaut does not go to the meaning of any particular word or words in the PRRTA Act The term economic rent appears nowhere in the Act nor does the term resources rent tax save for the title to the Act In particular the Act does not contain any explicitly economic terms whose application to a particular case would be assisted by economic evidence By explicitly economic terms I mean words such as market and competition which appear in Pt IV of the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth In proceedings under Pt IV of that Act the evidence of economists may be relied upon to aid in the identification of the relevant market and judgments about the effects historic or predictive of particular conduct on competition in a market 53 Re Michael concerned the application of statutory and Gas Access Code provisions to the determination of an access tariff for a gas pipeline Parker J Malcolm CJ and Anderson J agreeing referred to some of the terms of the relevant Act and the Code as being in common use in that field of economics which is concerned with competition policy or more particularly with the regulation of essential infrastructure at 107 His Honour observed that these words or phrases conveyed a meaning to those familiar with the field of economics differing from that which the words themselves would suggest in ordinary everyday usage He said at 107   As the subject matter is by nature conceptual there is no uniform accepted and certain meaning but there is a principle or theory the essential tenets of which are widely understood though there need not be uniform acceptance of them In my view expert evidence may relevantly and usefully inform the court as to this specialised usage of which the court would otherwise be unaware so that the court can determine whether the Act and Code is using particular words or phrases in their ordinary everyday usage or in the specialised usage among those versed in this field of economics  Importantly his Honour continued at 107    Further the expert evidence provides an appreciation of the nature and objectives of competition policy in the field of economics and in particular of the regulation of essential infrastructure so that the policy and objectives of the Act can be discerned with a greater and more reliable appreciation of the possibilities In addition the potential relevance of some concepts and provisions in the Act and Code can be more readily understood    In Visa  Tamberlin J observed in relation to Re Michael and other cases involving admissibility of expert economic evidence at 665   The emphasis in these cases is on informing and assisting the court with a view to illuminating an understanding of the terms used in relation to the issues raised His Honour also agreed with Lindgren J in Allstate Life Insurance Co v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd No 6 1996 64 FCR 79 that generally it is not for an expert to give evidence as to the application of a legislative provision as opposed to furnishing evidence from the viewpoint of an economist with respect to what factors can or should be taken into consideration or ignored   It is also appropriate to note his Honours prudential observation with which I agree that at 669   In ruling on the admissibility of the expert evidence at an early stage of the hearing I was conscious that there can be substantial difficulties particularly in relation to issues of relevance and appreciating the overall context against which to properly or fully consider admissibility The general approach which I took was to err on the side of admitting evidence which was on or close to the borderline on the basis that such evidence if admitted could be evaluated as to substance and weight in final submissions    Professor Garnauts

06_1303.xml,c12,cited,O'Grady v North Queensland Company Limited [1990] HCA 16 ; (1990) 169 CLR 356,Against that background the evidence which it is sought to elicit from Professor Garnaut does not go to the meaning of any particular word or words in the PRRTA Act The term economic rent appears nowhere in the Act nor does the term resources rent tax save for the title to the Act In particular the Act does not contain any explicitly economic terms whose application to a particular case would be assisted by economic evidence By explicitly economic terms I mean words such as market and competition which appear in Pt IV of the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth In proceedings under Pt IV of that Act the evidence of economists may be relied upon to aid in the identification of the relevant market and judgments about the effects historic or predictive of particular conduct on competition in a market 53 Re Michael concerned the application of statutory and Gas Access Code provisions to the determination of an access tariff for a gas pipeline Parker J Malcolm CJ and Anderson J agreeing referred to some of the terms of the relevant Act and the Code as being in common use in that field of economics which is concerned with competition policy or more particularly with the regulation of essential infrastructure at 107 His Honour observed that these words or phrases conveyed a meaning to those familiar with the field of economics differing from that which the words themselves would suggest in ordinary everyday usage He said at 107   As the subject matter is by nature conceptual there is no uniform accepted and certain meaning but there is a principle or theory the essential tenets of which are widely understood though there need not be uniform acceptance of them In my view expert evidence may relevantly and usefully inform the court as to this specialised usage of which the court would otherwise be unaware so that the court can determine whether the Act and Code is using particular words or phrases in their ordinary everyday usage or in the specialised usage among those versed in this field of economics  Importantly his Honour continued at 107    Further the expert evidence provides an appreciation of the nature and objectives of competition policy in the field of economics and in particular of the regulation of essential infrastructure so that the policy and objectives of the Act can be discerned with a greater and more reliable appreciation of the possibilities In addition the potential relevance of some concepts and provisions in the Act and Code can be more readily understood    In Visa  Tamberlin J observed in relation to Re Michael and other cases involving admissibility of expert economic evidence at 665   The emphasis in these cases is on informing and assisting the court with a view to illuminating an understanding of the terms used in relation to the issues raised His Honour also agreed with Lindgren J in Allstate Life Insurance Co v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd No 6 1996 64 FCR 79 that generally it is not for an expert to give evidence as to the application of a legislative provision as opposed to furnishing evidence from the viewpoint of an economist with respect to what factors can or should be taken into consideration or ignored   It is also appropriate to note his Honours prudential observation with which I agree that at 669   In ruling on the admissibility of the expert evidence at an early stage of the hearing I was conscious that there can be substantial difficulties particularly in relation to issues of relevance and appreciating the overall context against which to properly or fully consider admissibility The general approach which I took was to err on the side of admitting evidence which was on or close to the borderline on the basis that such evidence if admitted could be evaluated as to substance and weight in final submissions    Professor Garnauts evidence assumes that the Act is intended to tax economic rent as he explains that term The company relies upon various extrinsic materials antedating the passage of the Act as indicative of that purpose Assuming that purpose is made out then Professor Garnaut offers what amounts to the inference that the overall objective of the Act is to generate revenue without distorting business decisions on the amount or composition of investment or production This identified purpose is relied upon to assist the Court to decide in the first place whether the contentious hedging losses were expenses payable by Woodside Energy in relation to the sale of petroleum within the meaning of s 24a of the PRRTA Act Assuming that the hedging losses are properly to be called expenses the question reduces to whether they are expenses in relation to the sale The words in relation to and similar terms like in respect of or in connection with or just in have been considered in many cases and many contexts They denote a necessary connection between two subject matters which may be activities events persons or things The nature and closeness or remoteness of the connection depends upon context In Workers Compensation Board Qld v Technical Products Proprietary Limited 1988 HCA 49  1988 165 CLR 642 the term in respect of was said to have a wide meaning It  gathers meaning from the context in which it appears and it is that context which will determine the matters to which it extends at 653654 per Deane Dawson and Toohey JJ The words in relation to have been described as a prepositional phrase which is indefinite and which subject to any contrary indication derived from its context or drafting history  requires no more than a relationship whether direct or indirect between two subject matters OGrady v North Queensland Company Limited 1990 HCA 16  1990 169 CLR 356 at 376 McHugh J The term is indefinite and will not generally apply to any relationship no matter how remote The extent of the relationship required will depend upon the context in which the words are used Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Maritime Union of Australia 2001 FCA 1549  2001 114 FCR 472 at 482 Hill J and authorities there cited Two things may stand in relation to each other in a variety of ways The relationship may be spatial temporal or causal It may be a relationship of similarity or difference Relationships between things in the law do not simply exist to await discovery They are defined by the common law or by legislation and their authoritative interpreters The criteria by which a statutory test of relationship is to be applied will have to be relevant to and serve the purposes of the statute The relationship between claimed expenses and the sale of petroleum products in s 24a of the PRRTA Act cannot be the subject of a bright line definition covering all cases but it must lie within the bounds of relevance to the statutory purpose If that purpose can be explained or elucidated by reference to a recognised economic mechanism to which the Act is intended to give effect then expert evidence about the operating principles of that mechanism can be received Such evidence may not be material directly concerned with interpretation of provisions of the Act as is extrinsic material received pursuant to s 15AB of the Acts Interpretation Act  Nor can it justify any application of the Act beyond the bounds set by its language But it may help to identify the purpose of the statute and thus inform the application of ambulatory terms in it such as in relation to in s 24a The preceding observations do not import any concluded view about whether the assumption on which Professor Garnaut will base his evidence is made out That will require a closer consideration of the terms of the Act and the extrinsic materials relevant to its interpretation It is better done in the context of all the evidence including the extrinsic materials relied upon I am not prepared to rule Professor Garnauts evidence inadmissible I take it as evidence rather than as submission in that it purports to demonstrate that the economic mechanism to which the PRRTA Act is said to give effect would treat hedging losses as expenses in the way for which Woodside Energy contends If some of his evidence trespasses into argument I will simply treat it as such I do not regard him as offering evidence on the ultimate issue even if that were a difficulty Rather it proposes that a certain treatment of hedging losses would advance the purpose of the statute viewed in the light of the economic theory which underpins it I will therefore admit the evidence proposed to be called from Professor Garnaut Ultimately this is a decision about relevance It may be that in the light of further evidence and argument his evidence will be shown to be based upon a false assumption If that is so then it may be that it will be rejected as irrelevant I am not prepared to find on the materials presently before me that the assumption upon which he advances his evidence has been falsified It seems to me to be at least arguably relevant and so will be admitted  The admissibility of the evidence of Professor Walker   It is well established that evidence of accounting practice may be admitted in revenue cases so that the Court has the opportunity to characterise such things as receipts and payments for the purposes of the relevant statute by reference to accounting and commercial realities That is not to say that such evidence can displace the words of the statute Nor does it involve the expert witness in interpreting the statute But where as in this case there are terms used of indefinite import such as in relation to incurred  in relation to and made  in carrying on  operations then such evidence may properly inform their application having regard to the purpose of the statute and the context in which the provision appears In Rowe and Son Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation 1970 HCA 57  1971 124 CLR 421 Gibbs J referred to expert evidence that it was unusual to bring into the accounts of a trader making sales on terms only the payments received or receivable in the year in question and that to do so would not record the true position of the trading In connection with such evidence generally he said at 452   When the ITAA gives no directions on the point the question when income is earned and the method of accounting to be adopted for the purpose of ascertaining the income depend upon business conceptions and the principles and practices of accountancy   In BHP Billiton Professor Walker gave evidence as to the proper accounting treatment to be adopted in the accounts of a corporation such as BHP Billiton The passage from the judgment of Gibbs J quoted above was quoted in the joint judgment of Hill and Heerey JJ at 134   In Ogilvy Mather Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation 1990 95 ALR 663 Hill J in the Full Court referred to expert evidence which had been adduced from a professor of accounting and said at 703   Accounting evidence cannot be substituted for the test laid down by s 511 FCT v James Flood Pty Ltd 1953 HCA 65  1953 88 CLR 492 at 5067 Nevertheless as the Full Court of this court pointed out in Hooker Rex Pty Ltd v FCT 88 ATC 4392 at 4399    the tendency of judicial decision has been to place increasing reliance upon the concepts of business and the principles and practices of commercial accountancy not only in the ascertainment of income but also in the ascertainment of expenditure DCT SA v Executor Trustee and

06_1303.xml,c15,cited,Ogilvy & Mather Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1990) 95 ALR 663,Against that background the evidence which it is sought to elicit from Professor Garnaut does not go to the meaning of any particular word or words in the PRRTA Act The term economic rent appears nowhere in the Act nor does the term resources rent tax save for the title to the Act In particular the Act does not contain any explicitly economic terms whose application to a particular case would be assisted by economic evidence By explicitly economic terms I mean words such as market and competition which appear in Pt IV of the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth In proceedings under Pt IV of that Act the evidence of economists may be relied upon to aid in the identification of the relevant market and judgments about the effects historic or predictive of particular conduct on competition in a market 53 Re Michael concerned the application of statutory and Gas Access Code provisions to the determination of an access tariff for a gas pipeline Parker J Malcolm CJ and Anderson J agreeing referred to some of the terms of the relevant Act and the Code as being in common use in that field of economics which is concerned with competition policy or more particularly with the regulation of essential infrastructure at 107 His Honour observed that these words or phrases conveyed a meaning to those familiar with the field of economics differing from that which the words themselves would suggest in ordinary everyday usage He said at 107   As the subject matter is by nature conceptual there is no uniform accepted and certain meaning but there is a principle or theory the essential tenets of which are widely understood though there need not be uniform acceptance of them In my view expert evidence may relevantly and usefully inform the court as to this specialised usage of which the court would otherwise be unaware so that the court can determine whether the Act and Code is using particular words or phrases in their ordinary everyday usage or in the specialised usage among those versed in this field of economics  Importantly his Honour continued at 107    Further the expert evidence provides an appreciation of the nature and objectives of competition policy in the field of economics and in particular of the regulation of essential infrastructure so that the policy and objectives of the Act can be discerned with a greater and more reliable appreciation of the possibilities In addition the potential relevance of some concepts and provisions in the Act and Code can be more readily understood    In Visa  Tamberlin J observed in relation to Re Michael and other cases involving admissibility of expert economic evidence at 665   The emphasis in these cases is on informing and assisting the court with a view to illuminating an understanding of the terms used in relation to the issues raised His Honour also agreed with Lindgren J in Allstate Life Insurance Co v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd No 6 1996 64 FCR 79 that generally it is not for an expert to give evidence as to the application of a legislative provision as opposed to furnishing evidence from the viewpoint of an economist with respect to what factors can or should be taken into consideration or ignored   It is also appropriate to note his Honours prudential observation with which I agree that at 669   In ruling on the admissibility of the expert evidence at an early stage of the hearing I was conscious that there can be substantial difficulties particularly in relation to issues of relevance and appreciating the overall context against which to properly or fully consider admissibility The general approach which I took was to err on the side of admitting evidence which was on or close to the borderline on the basis that such evidence if admitted could be evaluated as to substance and weight in final submissions    Professor Garnauts evidence assumes that the Act is intended to tax economic rent as he explains that term The company relies upon various extrinsic materials antedating the passage of the Act as indicative of that purpose Assuming that purpose is made out then Professor Garnaut offers what amounts to the inference that the overall objective of the Act is to generate revenue without distorting business decisions on the amount or composition of investment or production This identified purpose is relied upon to assist the Court to decide in the first place whether the contentious hedging losses were expenses payable by Woodside Energy in relation to the sale of petroleum within the meaning of s 24a of the PRRTA Act Assuming that the hedging losses are properly to be called expenses the question reduces to whether they are expenses in relation to the sale The words in relation to and similar terms like in respect of or in connection with or just in have been considered in many cases and many contexts They denote a necessary connection between two subject matters which may be activities events persons or things The nature and closeness or remoteness of the connection depends upon context In Workers Compensation Board Qld v Technical Products Proprietary Limited 1988 HCA 49  1988 165 CLR 642 the term in respect of was said to have a wide meaning It  gathers meaning from the context in which it appears and it is that context which will determine the matters to which it extends at 653654 per Deane Dawson and Toohey JJ The words in relation to have been described as a prepositional phrase which is indefinite and which subject to any contrary indication derived from its context or drafting history  requires no more than a relationship whether direct or indirect between two subject matters OGrady v North Queensland Company Limited 1990 HCA 16  1990 169 CLR 356 at 376 McHugh J The term is indefinite and will not generally apply to any relationship no matter how remote The extent of the relationship required will depend upon the context in which the words are used Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Maritime Union of Australia 2001 FCA 1549  2001 114 FCR 472 at 482 Hill J and authorities there cited Two things may stand in relation to each other in a variety of ways The relationship may be spatial temporal or causal It may be a relationship of similarity or difference Relationships between things in the law do not simply exist to await discovery They are defined by the common law or by legislation and their authoritative interpreters The criteria by which a statutory test of relationship is to be applied will have to be relevant to and serve the purposes of the statute The relationship between claimed expenses and the sale of petroleum products in s 24a of the PRRTA Act cannot be the subject of a bright line definition covering all cases but it must lie within the bounds of relevance to the statutory purpose If that purpose can be explained or elucidated by reference to a recognised economic mechanism to which the Act is intended to give effect then expert evidence about the operating principles of that mechanism can be received Such evidence may not be material directly concerned with interpretation of provisions of the Act as is extrinsic material received pursuant to s 15AB of the Acts Interpretation Act  Nor can it justify any application of the Act beyond the bounds set by its language But it may help to identify the purpose of the statute and thus inform the application of ambulatory terms in it such as in relation to in s 24a The preceding observations do not import any concluded view about whether the assumption on which Professor Garnaut will base his evidence is made out That will require a closer consideration of the terms of the Act and the extrinsic materials relevant to its interpretation It is better done in the context of all the evidence including the extrinsic materials relied upon I am not prepared to rule Professor Garnauts evidence inadmissible I take it as evidence rather than as submission in that it purports to demonstrate that the economic mechanism to which the PRRTA Act is said to give effect would treat hedging losses as expenses in the way for which Woodside Energy contends If some of his evidence trespasses into argument I will simply treat it as such I do not regard him as offering evidence on the ultimate issue even if that were a difficulty Rather it proposes that a certain treatment of hedging losses would advance the purpose of the statute viewed in the light of the economic theory which underpins it I will therefore admit the evidence proposed to be called from Professor Garnaut Ultimately this is a decision about relevance It may be that in the light of further evidence and argument his evidence will be shown to be based upon a false assumption If that is so then it may be that it will be rejected as irrelevant I am not prepared to find on the materials presently before me that the assumption upon which he advances his evidence has been falsified It seems to me to be at least arguably relevant and so will be admitted  The admissibility of the evidence of Professor Walker   It is well established that evidence of accounting practice may be admitted in revenue cases so that the Court has the opportunity to characterise such things as receipts and payments for the purposes of the relevant statute by reference to accounting and commercial realities That is not to say that such evidence can displace the words of the statute Nor does it involve the expert witness in interpreting the statute But where as in this case there are terms used of indefinite import such as in relation to incurred  in relation to and made  in carrying on  operations then such evidence may properly inform their application having regard to the purpose of the statute and the context in which the provision appears In Rowe and Son Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation 1970 HCA 57  1971 124 CLR 421 Gibbs J referred to expert evidence that it was unusual to bring into the accounts of a trader making sales on terms only the payments received or receivable in the year in question and that to do so would not record the true position of the trading In connection with such evidence generally he said at 452   When the ITAA gives no directions on the point the question when income is earned and the method of accounting to be adopted for the purpose of ascertaining the income depend upon business conceptions and the principles and practices of accountancy   In BHP Billiton Professor Walker gave evidence as to the proper accounting treatment to be adopted in the accounts of a corporation such as BHP Billiton The passage from the judgment of Gibbs J quoted above was quoted in the joint judgment of Hill and Heerey JJ at 134   In Ogilvy Mather Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation 1990 95 ALR 663 Hill J in the Full Court referred to expert evidence

Australian Competition  Consumer Commission 1996 71 FCR 285 at 298G to 299B per Burchett and Kiefel JJ Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Southcorp Limited 2003 FCA 1369  2003 130 FCR 406 per Lindgren J In considering the period of disqualification it appears to me that I should have regard to the 15 propositions formulated by Santow J in Re HIH Insurance Limited in prov liq  Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Adler 2002 42 ACSR 80 at 97 to 99 565749 Those factors were summarised by McHugh J in Rich v Australian Securities and Investments Commission 2004 220 CLR 107 at 152154 49 as follows  The 15 propositions formulated by Santow J are as follows  Adler 2002 42 ACSR 80 at 9799     1 Disqualification orders are designed to protect the public from the harmful use of the corporate structure or from use that is contrary to proper commercial standards       2 The banning order is designed to protect the public by seeking to safeguard the public interest in the transparency and accountability of companies and in the suitability of directors to hold office       3 Protection of the public also envisages protection of individuals who deal with companies including consumers creditors shareholders and investors       4 The banning order is protective against present and future misuse of the corporate structure       5 The order has a motive of personal deterrence though it is not punitive     6 General deterrence is an object of the legislation     7 In assessing the fitness of an individual to manage a company it is necessary that the individual have an understanding of the proper role of the company director and the duty of due diligence that is owed to the company       8 Longer periods of disqualification are reserved for cases where contraventions have been of a serious nature such as those involving dishonesty       9 In assessing an appropriate length of prohibition consideration is given to the degree of seriousness of the contraventions the propensity of the defendant to engage in similar conduct in the future and the likely harm that may be caused to the public       10 It is necessary to balance the personal hardship to the defendant against the public interest and the need for protection of the public from any repeat of the defendants conduct       11 A mitigating factor in considering a period of disqualification is the likelihood of the defendant reforming       12 The eight criteria to govern the exercise of the courts powers of disqualification set out in Commissioner for Corporate Affairs WA v Ekamper 1987 12 ACLR 519 have been influential It was held that in making such an order it is necessary to assess   a the character of the defendant  b the nature of the breaches      c the structure of the company or companies and the nature of its or their business      d the interests of shareholders creditors and employees      e the risks to others from the continuation of the defendant as a director      f the honesty and competence of the defendant      g hardship to the defendant and to his or her personal and commercial interests and  h the defendants appreciation that future breaches could result in future proceedings        13 Factors that have led to the imposition of the longest periods of disqualification that is disqualifications of 25 years or more include   a large financial losses      b high propensity that the defendant may engage in similar activities or conduct  c activities undertaken in fields in which there was potential to do great financial damage such as in management and financial consultancy      d the defendants lack of contrition or remorse      e disregard for the law and compliance with corporate regulations      f dishonesty and intent to defraud and  g previous convictions and contraventions for similar activities       14 In cases in which the period of disqualification ranged from 7 years to 12 years the factors that led to the conclusion that these cases were serious though not the worst cases included   a serious incompetence and irresponsibility  b substantial loss      c the fact that the defendant had engaged in deliberate courses of conduct to enrich himself or herself at others expense but with lesser degrees of dishonesty  d continued knowing and wilful contraventions of the law and disregard for legal obligations and  e lack of contrition or acceptance of responsibility although that must be weighed against the prospect that the defendant may reform        15 The factors leading to the shortest disqualifications that is disqualifications for up to 3 years were       a although the defendant had personally gained from the conduct he or she had endeavoured to repay or partially repay the amounts misappropriated  b the defendant had no immediate or discernible future intention to hold a position as manager of a company and  c the defendant had expressed remorse and contrition acted on advice of professionals and had not contested the proceedings against him or her

06_1326.xml,c5,applied,Repatriation Commission v Deledio (1998) 83 FCR 82,In the proceeding before the Tribunal the applicant claimed that the post traumatic stress disorder and dysthymic or depressive disorder from which he suffered resulted from his service in Vietnam in particular an incident which took place in Vietnam on 9 November 1969 The Tribunal applying the fourstep test articulated by the Full Court of the Federal Court in Repatriation Commission v Deledio 1998 83 FCR 82  Deledio  found in favour of the applicant on application of three of the steps however found against the applicant on the final step which involved causation In short although there was no issue as to the fact that the applicant did suffer from post traumatic stress disorder and dysthymic disorder the Tribunal found that these incapacities of the applicant were not caused by the incident of 9 November 1969 and were not warcausedThe leading case articulating the process of reasoning the Tribunal is to undertake in considering a claim under the Act in respect of incapacity of a person from injury or disease or in respect of the death of a person related to service rendered by that person is the decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court in Repatriation Commission v Deledio 1998 83 FCR 82 The Full Court at 9798 said as follows 1 The Tribunal must consider all the material which is before it and determine whether that material points to a hypothesis connecting the injury disease or death with the circumstances of the particular service rendered by the person No question of fact finding arises at this stage If no such hypothesis arises the application must fail 2 If the material does raise such a hypothesis the Tribunal must then ascertain whether there is in force an SoP determined by the Authority under s 196B2 or 11 If no such SoP is in force the hypothesis will be taken not to be reasonable and in consequence the application must fail 3 If an SoP is in force the Tribunal must then form the opinion whether the hypothesis raised is a reasonable one It will do so if the hypothesis fits that is to say is consistent with the template to be found in the SoP The hypothesis raised before it must thus contain one or more of the factors which the Authority has determined to be the minimum which must exist and be related to the persons service as required by s 196B2d and e If the hypothesis does contain these factors it could neither be said to be contrary to proved or known scientific facts nor otherwise fanciful If the hypothesis fails to fit within the template it will be deemed not to be reasonable and the claim will fail 4 The Tribunal must then proceed to consider under s 1201 whether it is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the death was not warcaused or in the case of a claim for incapacity that the incapacity did not arise from a warcaused injury If not so satisfied the claim must succeed If the Tribunal is so satisfied the claim must fail It is only at this stage of the process that the Tribunal will be required to find facts from the material before it In so doing no question of onus of proof or the application of any presumption will be involvedAs I noted earlier in this judgment the Tribunal was satisfied that the period of defence service relevant to the claim of the applicant namely from 4 June 1969 until 15 May 1970 was operational service and eligible war service as those terms are defined in s 7 and s 6C of the Act Further the Tribunal was satisfied that there was evidence for the diagnoses of post traumatic stress disorder and dysthymic disorder in the reports of the psychiatrists Dr Athey and Dr MulhollandThe Tribunal was also satisfied that notwithstanding the fact that the applicant was on leave on 9 November 1969 this did not affect his status of being allotted for operational service during that timeFinally the Tribunal was satisfied that the applicant had not suffered injury as a result of serious default or wilful act as defined in s 9The Tribunal then considered the fourstep course as outlined in Deledio that the Tribunal is to take in considering a claim of this natureFirst the Tribunal concluded that there was material pointing to a hypothesis connecting the applicants claimed conditions of past traumatic stress disorder and dysthymic disorder with the events of 9 November 1969Accordingly the first Deledio step was satisfiedSecond the Tribunal considered the position with respect to SoPs SoPs are determined by the Repatriation Medical Authority pursuant to s 196B of the ActThe Tribunal concluded that two SoPs were relevant namely Instrument No 3 of 1999 as amended by Instrument No 54 of 1999 concerning post traumatic stress disorder and Instrument No 58 of 1998 concerning depressive disorder For the purposes of the claim the relevant paragraphs were  In the SoP concerning Depressive Disorder Instrument No 58 of 1998 pars 5 and 8 Paragraph 5 defines factors that must as a minimum exist before it can be said that a reasonable hypothesis has been raised connecting the depressive disorder with the circumstances of a persons relevant service including      b experiencing a severe psychosocial stressor or stressors within the two years immediately before the clinic onset of depressive disorder  Paragraph 8 defines severe psychosocial stressor as meaning   an identifiable occurrence that evokes feelings of substantial distress in an individual for example being shot at death or serious injury of a close friend or relative assault including sexual assault severe illness or injury experiencing a loss such as divorce or separation loss of employment major financial problems or legal problemsAccordingly the second Deledio step was satisfiedThird the Tribunal found that the hypothesis advanced namely that the psychiatric conditions of the applicant were attributable to the events of 9 November 1969 was reasonable in the context of both the SoPs concerning Depressive Disorder and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder In doing so the Tribunal accepted the summary of evidence given by the applicant and other witnessesAccordingly the third Deledio step was satisfiedHowever the Tribunal found against the applicant in respect of the fourth Deledio step In other words the Tribunal found that the incapacities of the applicant namely the post traumatic stress disorder and the dysthymic disorder were not warcaused In summary   a in relation to the claim for post traumatic stress disorder the Tribunal was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the incident at Nui Dat on 9 November 1969 did not have a significant effect on the applicant for reasons that    It was clear that when giving evidence the applicants recollections of the event were vague  The applicant remained some distance from the injured men and did not speak with them or provide assistance such as loading the wounded into a medivac helicopter  The evidence indicates that the applicant had no recall of any aspect of the event until he spoke with Mr Ellis at a reunion of personnel from his RAAF squadron 30 years later  The Tribunal was unable to accept the correctness of the applicants recall of the nature of his reaction to the sight of the wounded soldiers  The evidence of the applicant and Mr Ellis and Mr Smith both of whom also gave evidence was that after they left the minefield they undertook an uneventful tour of Vietnamese villages  On 14 November 1969 five days after the event the applicant wrote a letter to his parents referring to the day he spent with Mr Ellis and Mr Smith but not referring to the minefield incident  The evidence of Dr Barry was inter alia  that an inability to recollect details of a stressful event is a characteristic of post traumatic stress disorder however that the minefield incident was in itself not sufficient to result in post traumatic stress disorder Her diagnosis was that the applicants post traumatic stress disorder was based upon the impact of a range of experiences As a result of this however the Tribunal was concerned as to her evidence in the light of the applicants claim as the SoP concerning Post Traumatic Stress Disorder requires the applicant to experience a severe stressor  The Tribunal was of the view that if the events of 9 November 1969 did not constitute a severe stressor which was sufficient in Dr Barrys diagnosis to trigger post traumatic stress disorder it would also not result in the suppression of memory which is a symptom associated with that disorder  The evidence of Dr Athey was in the view of the Tribunal of limited use as Dr Athey was not made aware of the incident of 9 November 1969 by the applicant  The evidence of Dr Mulholland was in the view of the Tribunal coloured by the version of the events given by the applicant to Dr Mulholland namely that the applicant had been dragooned into an operation in which he was acting as an escort for the evacuation of wounded soldiers which lasted a few hours and which left him pretty much exposed The Tribunal was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that what actually occurred on 9 November 1969 was not consistent with the version relied upon by Dr Mulholland   b In any event the Tribunal stated that it was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the incident at Nui Dat was not an event that met the requirements of experiencing a severe stressor as provided for in the SoP concerning Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Accordingly the condition was not warcaused under s 9 c The analysis in relation to post traumatic stress disorder was equally applicable in relation to the applicants claim concerning dysthymic disorder namely as to whether the minefield incident was a severe psychosocial stressor The Tribunal was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the evidence did not disclose a reaction by the applicant which equated to substantial distress In the view of the Tribunal while there is evidence that the applicant experienced depression not long after returning to Australia this was as a result of events not associated with his service in Vietnam These events were also referred to by the medical experts specifically    the severance of the applicants relationship with his then girlfriend  the applicant learning that one of the crewmen with whom he had worked in Vietnam had been killed thereAs the Tribunal was of the view that the claim of the applicant did not satisfy the fourth Deledio step and was not warcaused the Tribunal affirmed the decision under review in relation to post traumatic stress disorder and depressive disorderIn terms of the fourstep test articulated in Deledio  which was applied by the Tribunal the only step which is in contention is the fourth step which involves consideration of causation As I noted earlier in this judgment the Tribunal was otherwise satisfied that there was material before it pointing to a hypothesis connecting the applicants claimed condition of depression and dysthymic disorder with the events of 9 November 1969 that there were relevant SoPs in force supporting the hypothesis and that the hypothesis was reasonableAs made clear by the decisions of the High Court in Byrnes and the Full Court in Deledio  once the decisionmaker has determined that the hypothesis raised is reasonable the decisionmaker must then proceed to consider under s 1201 whether it is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the injury was not warcaused  It is only at this stage that the decisionmaker will be required to find facts from the material before it As the High Court said in Byrnes    The claim will succeed unless a one or more of the facts necessary to support the hypothesis are disproved beyond reasonable doubt or b the truth of another fact in the material which is inconsistent with the hypothesis is proved beyond reasonable doubt thus disproving beyond reasonable doubt the hypothesisThe respondent has submitted that the appeal is misconceived in so far as it is asserted in the notice of appeal that the questions of law raised on the appeal involve the misconstruction or misapplication of the SoPs This is because the construction and application of the SoPs occurred at the third Deledio step and at that stage of the reasoning the Tribunal found in the applicants favourIn my view the respondents submission has merit In particular the questions of law in the notice of appeal numbered iii iv v and vii relate to issues which were decided by the Tribunal in the applicants favour in the third Deledio stepIn my view the submissions of the applicant on this point are not supported by analysis of the decision of the Tribunal The Tribunal in its reasoning did recognise that an objective and subjective component of experiencing a severe stressor must be evident In relation to post traumatic stress disorder the Tribunal referred to Stoddart  in relation to dysthymic disorder the Tribunal referred to White v Repatriation Commission 2004 FCA 633  a decision of Spender J which in turn referred to the test in Stoddart  Applying the test in relation to both disorders the Tribunal was of the view within the context of the third Deledio step that the material concerning the applicants observation of and reactions to the minefield incident did point to the existence of both objective and subjective componentsHowever in order for the post traumatic stress disorder and dysthymic disorder of the applicant to be related to the applicants service within the meaning of the Act clearly the Tribunal needed to consider the evidence within the fourth Deledio step as to the events that occurred and whether the applicant experienced a severe stressor in relation to post traumatic stress disorder or a severe psychosocial stressor in relation to dysthymic disorder At par 38 and par 39 the Tribunal found   The extent of the applicants involvement was in seeing some injured soldiers and I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that this was not an event that meets the requirements of experiencing a severe stressor as provided for in the Statements of Principles for post traumatic stress disorderIn relation to dysthymic disorder the analysis above is equally applicable to whether the minefield incident was a severe psychosocial stressorAccordingly the Tribunal formed the view on the basis of the evidence before it that the applicants disorders were not warcaused It was not necessary for the Tribunal to consider whether the incident might evoke feelings of intense fear helplessness or horrorIn my view no error of law arises in the Tribunals consideration of this issue

06_1326.xml,c8,cited,Stoddart v Repatriation Commission [2003] FCA 334,In his grounds of appeal the applicant claimed that the Tribunal ignored the cognitive impairment aspect of the disorders and failed to make a finding on whether the applicants response involved intense fear helplessness or horror This ground of appeal was supported by submissions that the Tribunal failed to make findings as to whether this event might evoke such feelings and that the Tribunal did not apply the test in Stoddart v Repatriation Commission 2003 FCA 334 and put itself in the position of Mr Byrne when he experienced the casualties which had occurred shortly prior to the arrival at the siteThe applicant also claimed in questions of law ii and iv that the Tribunal failed to consider whether the applicant subjectively experienced a severe stressor Post Traumatic Stress Disorder SoP and that the Tribunal failed to consider whether the applicant subjectively experienced a severe psychosocial stressor Depressive Disorder SoPIn making these claims the applicant referred to the decision of Manfield J in Stoddart  In that case Mansfield J found inter alia  that the test of  experiencing a severe stressor in the SoP concerning Post Traumatic Stress Disorder encompasses a subjective element His Honour in that case held at 40 that the Tribunal erred because it had concluded that the acceptance of the applicants claims about the occasions giving rise to his fears do not objectively satisfy the relevant factors namely being confronted with an event or events that involved actualor threat of death or serious injuryHis Honour said   In my judgment the language of the definition of experiencing a severe stressor caters for the applicant experiencing or being confronted with an event or events that involved threat of death or serious injury or a threat to physical integrity if the event or events which are said to constitute the threat judged objectively from the point of view of a reasonable person in the position of and with the knowledge of the person experiencing those events are capable of and did convey ie are subjectively experienced the risk of death or serious injury or to physical integrityThe applicant before me emphasises the words risk of death of serious injury in the judgment of Mansfield J and submits that the Tribunal did not use this test when assessing whether Mr Byrne subjectively satisfied the SoPsIn my view the submissions of the applicant on this point are not supported by analysis of the decision of the Tribunal The Tribunal in its reasoning did recognise that an objective and subjective component of experiencing a severe stressor must be evident In relation to post traumatic stress disorder the Tribunal referred to Stoddart  in relation to dysthymic disorder the Tribunal referred to White v Repatriation Commission 2004 FCA 633  a decision of Spender J which in turn referred to the test in Stoddart  Applying the test in relation to both disorders the Tribunal was of the view within the context of the third Deledio step that the material concerning the applicants observation of and reactions to the minefield incident did point to the existence of both objective and subjective components

06_1334.xml,c0,referred_to,Australian Securities Commission v Bell (1991) 32 FCR 517,The respondent said that given the power to administer an oath or affirmation s 524 the fact that the obligation to answer questions is subject to only limited excuses s 526 and s 53 and the right to legal representation s 523 a power in the ABC Commissioner to regulate and control an examination must be implied That conclusion was said the respondent supported by the decision of the Full Court of this Court in Australian Securities Commission v Bell 1991 32 FCR 517  Bell In Bell  an inspector was conducting an examination in the course of an investigation by the Australian Securities Commission the Commission and he made an order that an examinee not be represented by a particular legal practitioner The order was made on the basis that the legal practitioner had appeared for a number of examinees and the legal practitioners firm had been involved in the preparation of a prospectus which might be under consideration in the course of the investigationThe Australian Securities Commission Act 1989 Cth contained provisions to the effect that an examinee may have legal representation s 231  that an examination was to be in private s 221  that the inspector could determine who was to be present at the examination s 221  and provisions dealing with the inspectors powers to control the conduct of a legal representative at an examination s 232The decisions in A B and D and Bell were referred to with approval by the Queensland Court of Appeal in Re Whiting 1994 1 Qd R 561 A firm of solicitors was acting for a police officer who was the subject of a complaint under the Criminal Justice Act 1989 Qld and for three police officers who were witnesses in the proceeding The Chairman of the Criminal Justice Commission ruled that the same legal representative would not be authorised by the Commission to represent both the potential witnesses and the officer against whom the complaint was made An application to the Supreme Court challenging the order was dismissedIn Stockbridge v Ogilvie 1993 43 FCR 244 French J followed Bell and in the course of his reasons said at 254   Where one lawyer seeks to represent a number of examinees in the same investigation it may be thought that there is a risk that without consciously intending any impropriety that lawyer might divulge to one examinee what has passed in the examination of another The extension of a restriction to all members of a given firm may be controversial see Wood v National Companies  Securities Commission 1990 2 WAR 176 However there are matters of judgment and assessment involved It is of course not the role of the ASC to supervise the lawyerclient relationships of those who appear before it in s 19 examinations It is only where a conflict of interest has some actual or potential impact on the investigative process that a direction based on such a concern would be within powerIn Gangemi v Australian Securities and Investment Commission 2003 FCA 494  2003 129 FCR 284 French J considered whether the Australian Securities and Investment Commission the Commission had the power to give a nondisclosure direction and to direct that solicitors who had acted for other persons the Commission might wish to examine be excluded from the applicants examinations He followed Bell and his own decision in Stockbridge v Ogilvie supra and held that the Commission had both these powersThe statutory provisions in this case are very general They may be contrasted with the quite detailed provisions under consideration in cases such as A B and D and Bell  Nevertheless I think it is clear that the ABC Commissioner must have the power to regulate and control the conduct of proceedings before him He can determine when and where an examination will be held and providing a proper basis exists he can regulate and control how the examination is to proceed and who may be present He is charged with the function of conducting an investigation into suspected unlawful conduct and may bring proceedings for a civil penalty in relation to that conduct He must be taken to have by implication the power to make orders or give directions which will ensure the integrity of the investigation and to a point its effectiveness In my opinion he has the power to exclude a particular legal practitioner from acting or appearing for an examinee at an examinationIt is appropriate for me to consider whether insofar as the direction is within power there was a proper basis to exercise the power The test as formulated in A B and D is whether the decisionmaker concludes on reasonable grounds and in good faith that to allow the representation either will or may prejudice the investigation which it is obliged to carry out pursuant to the terms of its statute at 448 In Bell  Lockhart J said that he favoured a test which presented a slightly higher barrier of will or is likely to prejudice the investigation although he went on to say that the difference in practical application will depend on judicial approach to the facts of the particular case at 522 In my respectful opinion although there is something to be said for a test which presents a slightly higher barrier the weight of authority is in favour of the test of will or may prejudice the investigation and it is that test which I will apply
06_1334.xml,c1,referred_to,Constantine v Trade Practices Commissioner (1994) 48 FCR 141,The first question is whether examinations under s 52 of the Act are to be conducted in private I did not understand the applicant to suggest that the examinations are not to be conducted in private In my opinion they are to be conducted in private In Constantine v Trade Practices Commissioner 1994 48 FCR 141  Constantine  a person the applicant was served with a notice pursuant to s 1551c of the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth requiring him to give evidence about matters specified in the notice and to produce documents He was permitted to have legal representation within certain limits However as a condition of that permission the applicants legal representative was required to give certain undertakings as to nondisclosure That condition was challenged by the applicant Jenkinson J first considered whether examinations pursuant to a notice under s 1551c of the Trade Practices Act 1974 Cth were private He held that they were private He said at 146147   The authorities on which Mr Merkel relied as favouring privacy in the conduct of investigations into suspected contraventions of the law are concerned with prohibition of the investigators inclination to proceed in public not with prohibition of disclosure by those examined of what has occurred during the examination see Hearts of Oak Assurance Co Ltd v AttorneyGeneral 1932 AC 392 Re Pergamon Press Ltd 1971 Ch 388 at 400 404 Finnane v Australian Consolidated Press Ltd 1978 2 NSWLR 435 In the latter case Needham J observed at 445 There is much to be said for the proposition that the inspector investigating the affairs of several companies under Pt VIA of the Companies Act 1961 NSW is bound to observe the confidences of the witnesses whom he examines none of those cases has anything to say about the right of the witness to disclose what the inspector said to him and what he said to the inspector However observance of the confidences of the witnesses requires privacy of their examination My conclusion is that an examination pursuant to a notice under s 1551c served for the purpose of investigating whether a contravention of the Act has occurred is required to be held in private A clear legislative intention is to be discerned in the provisions of the Act particularly in Pt VI and s 163 that the Commission should have the function of taking and authorising curial proceedings civil and criminal in respect of contraventions of the Act Exercise in public of the investigative powers conferred by s 155 on the Commission to enable it to determine whether or not a contravention has occurred and to procure means of proving in a curial proceeding that a contravention has occurred is so likely to be inimical to the effectiveness of the investigation and to interests of those who are the subjects of investigation both witnesses and those suspected of contravention that the requirement of privacy may be seen to have been intended by the legislature notwithstanding that the requirement is not explicitly stated in the Act cf Hearts of Oak Assurance Co Ltd v AttorneyGeneral supra at 401  Whatever may be the position of the person who is examined on oath or affirmation there is authority for the conclusion that his legal representative present during a private investigative examination may lawfully be required by the investigator to undertake not for a certain time to disclose to others what has been disclosed to the legal representative during the examination Re London and Northern Bank Ltd 1902 2 Ch D 73 was a case in which a solicitor was held by the Court of Appeal to have been rightly required as a condition of his being permitted to represent a witness under private investigative examination by the liquidator in a windingup to undertake to the Registrar conducting the examination not to disclose to others information required at the examination The solicitor was employed by a firm which was acting for a company then engaged in litigation with the company in liquidation and that circumstance was noticed by the members of the Court as justifying the Registrars requirementIn this case the requirement that an examination be held in private arises by implication rather than by reason of an express provision I do not think that that is a ground upon which to distinguish what the Full Court said in Bankers Trust and I agree with what Jenkinson J said in Constantine at 148   Whether the legislative requirement of examination in private be expressly given or laboriously found the necessary implications must in my opinion be the sameHaving decided that an examination must be conducted in private and that an ABC Commissioner has the power to make a nondisclosure direction I now address the question whether the ABC Commissioner has the power to direct that an examinee not be represented at an examination by a particular legal practitioner The right to legal representation is an important right and may well have been implied in this case even in the absence of s 523 of the Act  Constantine per Jenkinson J at 150It seems to me that having regard to the relevant statutory provisions and the authorities which I will now discuss the ABC Commissioner has such a power

06_1334.xml,c7,referred_to,National Companies and Securities Commission v Bankers Trust Australian Ltd (1989) 24 FCR 217,In National Companies and Securities Commission v Bankers Trust Australian Ltd 1989 24 FCR 217  Bankers Trust  a person who appeared before the National Companies and Securities Commission during the course of an investigation was required not to discuss the evidence given with any person other than his legal counsel A similar direction was given to his legal counsel Those directions were challenged on the basis inter alia that there was no power to make them The Full Court of this Court held that there was power to make a nondisclosure direction but a majority held that the particular order was beyond power because it went beyond the period in respect of which the Commissions implied power to prohibit disclosure could reasonably operate Only the general question of power is relevant here There were express statutory provisions to the effect that the Commission could direct that the hearing take place in private and give directions as to the persons who may be present at a private hearing Lockhart J noted those provisions and said that the power to maintain the privacy of the evidence was a necessary element in the private hearing itself His Honour said at 221   It may appear odd that a like power was not vested in terms in the Commission when hearings commence as private hearings In my opinion the answer is not that there is a lacuna in the legislation but that the power of the Commission to conduct a hearing in private pursuant to s 36 and the express power conferred by s 365 to determine who should be present carries with it as an integral element of such a hearing the power to give directions preventing or restricting the publication of evidence given before it or of matters contained in documents lodged with it otherwise the power to hold hearings in private would be of little value The essence of a private hearing before the Commission is that what takes place is in private and therefore by definition and of necessity not open or accessible to the publicIn this case the requirement that an examination be held in private arises by implication rather than by reason of an express provision I do not think that that is a ground upon which to distinguish what the Full Court said in Bankers Trust and I agree with what Jenkinson J said in Constantine at 148   Whether the legislative requirement of examination in private be expressly given or laboriously found the necessary implications must in my opinion be the same
06_1334.xml,c8,referred_to,"National Crime Authority v A, B and D (1988) 18 FCR 439",The respondent also referred to the decision of the Full Court of this Court in National Crime Authority v A B and D 1988 18 FCR 439  A B and D  and said that the reasoning in that case was applicable to the case before him The power of a statutory authority to regulate its own proceedings included as an implied power the more specific power to exclude a particular legal representative The respondent gave examples of how an examination could be seriously undermined if there was no power to exclude a particular legal representative He said   The absence of a power to preclude a particular legal practitioner from representing a witness could in some circumstances seriously undermine the efficacy of an examination For example if a lawyer acted improperly in an examination by for example prompting a witness or repeatedly obstructing the examination the absence of the relevant power may seriously prejudice the examination To take another example if the legal practitioner was also the subject of the particular investigation it would be highly undesirable for the legal practitioner to represent the witness and heshe should not be permitted to do so These examples highlight the need for the relevant powerThe respondent then turned to the exercise of the relevant discretion In considering this question he proceeded on the basis that the question was whether there were reasonable grounds to conclude that the representation either will or may prejudice the investigation He adopted this test in preference to a test formulated in terms of will or is likely to prejudice the investigation although he said that even on the latter test he would exercise the discretion in the same wayThe respondent recognised as an important factor to which he must give weight the applicants wish to have present the legal representative of his choice However he was satisfied that the examination of the applicant would canvass the same subject matter as was raised with B on 9 November 2005 Even accepting as he did that there was no suggestion that Ms Boots would deliberately prejudice the investigation he said there were reasonable grounds to conclude that Ms Boots representation of the applicant at the examination will or may prejudice the investigation The essence of his reasoning in that regard is contained in the following two paragraphs   Because of Ms Boots attendance at the previous examination Ms Boots is aware of the topics and issues that are likely to be covered by counsel assisting in questions and how counsel assisting is likely to proceed Ms Boots is aware of the answers given by the previous witness and how the previous witness handled questions If consistent with Ms Boots duty to Mr Bonan she has taken Mr Bonan to the issues and matters likely to arise Mr Bonan may be aware of the general nature of the questions that will be asked and the areas that will be focused on There is accordingly a real risk that the evidence of Mr Bonan may be influenced by the evidence provided by the previous witness In my experience in this industry it is very important that witnesses give evidence unaffected by any evidence given by other witnesses   These comments are by no means a criticism of Ms Boots I accept Mr Jacobs submissions that there is no suggestion that Ms Boots will deliberately prejudice the investigation However consistent with Ms Boots duty to Mr Bonan I accept that there is a real risk that Ms Boots may unintentionally perhaps subconsciously reveal to Mr Bonan matters that would in effect forewarn him This would prejudice the investigationAfter referring to the authorities dealing with the power to restrict publication Beaumont and Einfeld JJ said at 232   In the present case the Commission was given expressly the power to direct that the hearing take place privately In aid of that power the Commission was also given in our opinion by necessary implication the power to take all reasonable steps which when viewed objectively were necessary in order to ensure that the hearing was conducted privately The Commission is entitled to regulate its proceedings to avoid a situation arising where the confidentiality of information obtained by it may be exposed to the risk of premature disclosure cf National Crime Authority v A B and D 1988 18 FCR 439 at 447448 This is not to say that the information should always be regarded as confidential But in order to conduct a hearing properly it is necessary that the Commission have the power to prohibit at least during the hearing itself the disclosure of information obtained at the hearing Publication of that material before the conclusion of the hearing could prejudice the effective conduct of the hearing It follows in our opinion that it is proper to imply in the Act a power in the Commission to prevent or restrict the premature publication of evidence given at the hearing or to put the matter positively rather than negatively the Commission had the power by necessary implication to take all reasonable steps which were necessary to secure a private rather than a public hearingIn A B and D  the Authority the Authority was conducting a special investigation and for that purpose it held a number of hearings Under the National Crime Authority Act 1984 Cth a witness at an examination had a right to be represented by a legal practitioner s 254 A witness was represented by a legal practitioner and that witnesss spouse also gave evidence and was represented by the same legal practitioner It was proposed that the same practitioner would appear for three further witnesses The Authority decided that the legal practitioner could not appear for the three proposed witnesses and they challenged the decision under the Administrative Decisions Judicial Review Act 1977 Cth Their challenge was initially successful but failed on appeal to the Full Court of this Court There is no doubt that the statutory provisions under consideration in A B and D were quite different from the statutory provisions in this case There were express provisions providing that hearings were to be held in private and that the Authority could make a nondisclosure direction There was a provision giving the Authority incidental powers which at one point in its reasons the Full Court of this Court described as the critical provision at 447 The offences which were to be the subject of an investigation were serious criminal offences The Court said at 446447   A starting point for the consideration of the problem is the nature of the Authority and of its functions It is concerned with investigating either generally on its own initiative or specially on references to it pursuant to ss 13 or 14 of the Act a wide range of serious criminal activity or suspected criminal activity in the community The powers it has are expressed in wide terms and it is clear that the legislature intended its powers to be extensive and farreaching Even without s 19 there could be no doubt notwithstanding the provisions of s 254 that the Authority had power to regulate its own proceedings with a view to ensuring that they were not prejudiced or exposed to the risk of being prejudiced by the conduct of any person whether involved in a hearing before it or otherwise    We think that the essential nature of the Authority and the functions with which it has been entrusted when considered along with s 19 of the Act lead to the conclusion that the power exists We also regard s 468 as a further factor reinforcing this conclusion It may seem strange that a provision dealing with meetings of the Authority should be relevant to the problem but s 253 expressly applies s 46 to hearings  Lockhart J said that an inspector must have the power effectively to regulate and control the investigation which he is conducting at 520 His Honours reasons were closely linked to the statutory provisions under consideration although he did say at 522   The power created by s 221 is expressed in positive terms namely the giving of directions about who may be present and not in negative terms about who may not be present s 222 achieves this to a degree It seems to me however that to sensibly construe s 221 requires that the inspector be authorised to direct who may and who may not be present The express power to give directions about who may be present implies a like power about who may not be present  It may be that the inspectors power to exclude a particular lawyer would exist as being reasonably incidental or ancillary to the proper conduct of the examination even if the specific power conferred by s 221 was absent but it is not necessary to consider this because of the power conferred by s 221    The Full Court concluded in the A case National Crime Authority v A 1988 18 FCR 439 that the National Crime Authority had the power to regulate its own proceedings by excluding a legal practitioner if it concludes on reasonable grounds and in good faith that to allow the representation either will or may prejudice the investigation which it is obliged to carry out pursuant to the terms of its statute I have reached a similar conclusion with respect to ss 22 and 23 of the Act though in this case my preferred test of will or is likely to presents a slightly higher barrier than will or may but the difference in practical application will depend on judicial approach to the facts of the particular case In my view the differences between the two Acts and the basis of the power being s 221 coupled with an abuse of power under s 231 as opposed to the broader policy considerations relied on in the A case lead to this resultThe decisions in A B and D and Bell were referred to with approval by the Queensland Court of Appeal in Re Whiting 1994 1 Qd R 561 A firm of solicitors was acting for a police officer who was the subject of a complaint under the Criminal Justice Act 1989 Qld and for three police officers who were witnesses in the proceeding The Chairman of the Criminal Justice Commission ruled that the same legal representative would not be authorised by the Commission to represent both the potential witnesses and the officer against whom the complaint was made An application to the Supreme Court challenging the order was dismissedThe statutory provisions in this case are very general They may be contrasted with the quite detailed provisions under consideration in cases such as A B and D and Bell  Nevertheless I think it is clear that the ABC Commissioner must have the power to regulate and control the conduct of proceedings before him He can determine when and where an examination will be held and providing a proper basis exists he can regulate and control how the examination is to proceed and who may be present He is charged with the function of conducting an investigation into suspected unlawful conduct and may bring proceedings for a civil penalty in relation to that conduct He must be taken to have by implication the power to make orders or give directions which will ensure the integrity of the investigation and to a point its effectiveness In my opinion he has the power to exclude a particular legal practitioner from acting or appearing for an examinee at an examinationIt is appropriate for me to consider whether insofar as the direction is within power there was a proper basis to exercise the power The test as formulated in A B and D is whether the decisionmaker concludes on reasonable grounds and in good faith that to allow the representation either will or may prejudice the investigation which it is obliged to carry out pursuant to the terms of its statute at 448 In Bell  Lockhart J said that he favoured a test which presented a slightly higher barrier of will or is likely to prejudice the investigation although he went on to say that the difference in practical application will depend on judicial approach to the facts of the particular case at 522 In my respectful opinion although there is something to be said for a test which presents a slightly higher barrier the weight of authority is in favour of the test of will or may prejudice the investigation and it is that test which I will apply
